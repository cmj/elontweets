You can argue that npr is good or bad for journalism. Regardless, this is clearly an opinion and Mr musk is entitled to have one. Stop abusing CN and argue in the comment section.

Defunding NPR undermines its purpose: to provide fact-based journalism free from corporate influence. Public funding ensures accountability to the public, not advertisers, preventing bias driven by financial incentives. Cutting its funding weakens public-interest journalism. https://cpb.org/aboutpb/what-public-media
