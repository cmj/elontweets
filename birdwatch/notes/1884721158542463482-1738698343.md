NNN. The post is not misleading & isn't making any claims. 

Also, despite a short-lived surplus during the Clinton presidency, the national debt increased by over $1T making Clinton the second biggest deficit spender in US history by 2001.

Bill Clinton was President of the United States from January 20, 1993 – January 20, 2001

1998-2001 were the only years in the last 50 where the US federal government budget had a surplus. If a surplus continues for a long time, it can be used to pay off debt.
