[Sun Feb 09, 2025 17:10:17 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)„Äêùóï„Äë: What‚Äôs actually scary is that the government has your personal info! How much do you trust the deep state? Btw, at PayPal, we had the detailed financial data of 100M+ people. Never once was it abused. [@BrianEastwood_X] If Elon Musk did have your personal data would you care?

phenomenal field sparrows notes is a completely irrelevant fact. 

Musk sold PayPal in 2002 so using a 2022 databreach to note this post is irrelevant at best. https://www.newsweek.com/how-old-elon-musk-was-major-moments-business-career-twitter-1755463

NNM Regarding the note saying it is illegal to share personal information - elected officials aren‚Äôt the ones accessing people‚Äôs info.  It‚Äôs employees and yes - contractors.

NNN - 'phenomenal field sparrow' is factually incorrect citing data breaches in 2022, for the simple reason that Musk sold Paypal in 2002.
There were no breaches during his period of ownership.
Check your facts before posting these nonsensical notes.

While ‚Äúabuse,‚Äù may be speculative, PayPal itself has been the victim of a number of data breaches‚Äîincluding a 2022 incident which leaked the information of over 35,000 users. The organization was fined more than $2,000,000.

It's not a matter of trust, it's illegal for the government departments to give the confidential details of private citizens (or access to them) to a private individual, and the President can't give permission.
