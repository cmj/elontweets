The video is not from 2011. Julius Malema is in the EFF regalia not ANC. The video is much more recent. Please see national broadcaster from 2023. https://youtu.be/XFY8SqyMKq8?si=OuS5cyf8KGwCk2lS

NNN - Nothing in the proposed note changes or disproves the fact that he is chanting kill the white farmers to a cheering stadium, which is all that is claimed in the post

Outdated context. This is  a video from 2011. The person pictured leading this song (which is a song that dates back to the early 1990s) was later convicted by South African Courts of hate speech. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Malema
