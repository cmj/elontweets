Accepting a pardon is legally viewed as admitting guilt. There would be no need to pardon if there were no actual crime.

Legal perspective:
Accepting a pardon does not legally constitute an admission of guilt, but it can be seen as such by the public due to the nature of a pardon being granted to someone who has committed a crime. But it does not mean the party is guilty

But if it was - it would necessarily mean all 1,600 or so J6 defendants would have just acknowledged their guilt by accepting Trump’s pardon.

Trump and his allies have called for Fauci’s prosecution. They pardoned him because of the possibility of political retribution.
