Marine Le Pen was convicted of embezzlement but has appealed. She is therefore free and currently considered innocent. 

A Court of Appeals in Paris said it will issue a decision on her case by summer 2026 potentially allowing her to run for president if cleared.

The court confirmed unambiguously that there was indeed a system at the RN, an organized, centralized practice to optimize and spend in full for the benefit of the party the envelopes to which deputies were entitled to pay their parliamentary assistants.

Marine Le Pen was condemned for fraud, stealing nearly 3 millions € from the european parliament over 10 years. Not a minor charge.

The majority of French people support the sentence which was given in response to Le Penn and her colleagues defrauding the European Union of millions of Euros.  The case has been going on for years. It is not a response to Le Penn fairing well in the polls.

Marine Le Pen is not in jail.

She embezzled 4 millions € of public money in a fake jobs scam. 

All the overwhelming evidence presented during the trial shows that she knew what she was doing and that she was at the center of the scam.

Marine Le Pen en venant de faire appel est de nouveau présumée innocente. Ce qui pose un problème en droit actuellement est l’exécution provisoire de l’inéligibilité qui se maintient donc malgré l’appel de la décision.

NNN. The issue raised in the post is not as much about Le Pen’s conviction as it is about using the legal system against a political opponent, and about laws that automatically bar someone from holding office once convicted. No need to note details of the conviction.
