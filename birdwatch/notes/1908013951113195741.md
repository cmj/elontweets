The majority of French people support the sentence which was given in response to Le Penn and her colleagues defrauding the European Union of millions of Euros.  The case has been going on for years. It is not a response to Le Penn fairing well in the polls.

Marine Le Pen is not in jail.

She embezzled 4 millions € of public money in a fake jobs scam.
