NNN: It's clearly just an animated video that Elon likes and presumably aligns with his vision of what he wants Mars to look like in the future.

Those posting the need for a community note need to get yours revoked! You obviously have no clue about the purpose of CNs

NNN - this is a series of AI generated videos stitched together into one, not an ad for SpaceX as the current note implies. Elon is allowed to post videos he finds interesting, stop abusing CNs.

NNN I'm sure the report function is intended for dealing with inappropriate ads. I don't think community notes are intended for dealing with ads.

This is an undisclosed ad for SpaceX, which is an interplanetary tourism company. The rules of x.com are against such undisclosed advertisements https://business.x.com/en/help/ads-policies
