Ryanair is named after its founder Tony Ryan.
This is the only Ryan that matters.

NNN - It being a joke aside, a Ryan is not currently in charge. Community noter posted the founder’s obituary. 

Current CEO is Michael O’Leary. Someone buying the company could put “A Ryan” in charge.

TCN - If a truth engine spends its energy correcting sarcasm, it will eventually lose the trust required to correct actual lies. This is a "Note Abuse" signal because the contributor is using the tool to express an opinion rather than debunk harmful misinformation. (NNN)
