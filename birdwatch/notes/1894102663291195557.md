[Mon Feb 24, 2025 19:10:40 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)„Äêùóï„Äë: Very one-sided [@charliekirk11] Ukraine aid is the perfect example of how America used to ALWAYS get ripped off: America GIFTED Ukraine $250 billion in munitions and aid, but got nothing in return. Europe LOANED $145 billion in financial and military aid to Ukraine. America is done being taken for suckers. | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1894102663291195557

President Zelensky has said the funding received by the US is a grant and is under no obligation to repay it.

America has not given $250 bn to Ukraine. 

$120 bn have been delivered, of which ~$20 bn are loans.

Europe has provided $136 bn of which ~60% is gifts (most  military and humanitarian aid) and 40% is loans (most of the financial aid).

These claims have been debunked multiple times now.
The USA hasn't giften 250 billion but rather 183 billion of which at least 20 billion is a loan.
