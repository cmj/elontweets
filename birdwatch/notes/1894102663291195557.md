[Mon Feb 24, 2025 19:10:40 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: Very one-sided [@charliekirk11] Ukraine aid is the perfect example of how America used to ALWAYS get ripped off: America GIFTED Ukraine $250 billion in munitions and aid, but got nothing in return. Europe LOANED $145 billion in financial and military aid to Ukraine. America is done being taken for suckers. | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1894102663291195557

#### MISLEADING

These claims have been debunked multiple times now.
The USA hasn't giften 250 billion but rather 183 billion of which at least 20 billion is a loan.
