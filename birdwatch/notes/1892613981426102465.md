NNN - Musk is clearly expressing an opinion. Additionally, due to the community-based nature of community notes, it is possible for a large enough group to apply a factually incorrect note to a post.

"Community Notes cannot be gamed or manipulated and Elon is totally wrong!" 
This is exactly what gamed or manipulated Community Notes would say.

Zelenski did in fact and not the parliament extended the martial law making it impossible to hold elections. Only the president can declare martial law. 
Zelenski knew he would lose the elections.

Community notes are working perfectly. "FIX" is a codename for censoring independent citizens who pointed out Elon Musk's links to Putin. Only now is Musk spreading the Russian disinformation that Putin has insisted on spreading for months about the Ukrainian elections.

No manipulation can be done to Community Notes. A note would need enough contributors from different points of view to rate that note as helpful.
As per X, Community Notes is an open and transparent process with the algorithm being open source.

Under Ukraine‚Äôs constitution, it is not legal to hold national elections during a period of martial law. The martial law has been extended a few months at a time by the parliament, not by Zelensky.

Elon's own AI, Grok, says that there is no evidence to support his claim that Community Notes is being "gamed" by "legacy media" or government.

Elections: Ukraine‚Äôs constitution prohibits elections during martial law which is a legal framework. 
Approval: Independent polls show Zelensky still enjoys support among Ukrainians. 
Media: Temporary wartime broadcast consolidation ‚â† equivalent to total media control.
