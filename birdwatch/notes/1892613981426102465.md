Noters claiming that the Ukrainian constitution prevents holding an election during martial law is incorrect. It is the ¬´Law of Ukraine¬ª from 2015 that has a section (article 19(1)) regarding this.

Ukranian constitution attached.

Zelenski did in fact and not the parliament extended the martial law making it impossible to hold elections. Only the president can declare martial law. 
Zelenski knew he would lose the elections.

The electron result in 2019 is completely irrelevant.

Musk is expressing his opinion on the state of community notes.

Just because something is part of the Ukranian constition, doesn't mean Musk has to agree. Furthermore, it may not be fully appropriate and can be changed.

Notes are corrupted (sometimes) huge accounts spam certain accounts and upvote each other and downvote anyone else,  making their accounts huge (1000+ rating) and reporting  doesnt work as it doesn't go through. Also when you call this out you get downvoted and blocked.

According to the official Community Notes guide, there is no way to "game" the system

"Community Notes doesn't work by majority rules. ... - notes require agreement between contributors who have sometimes disagreed in their past ratings. This helps prevent one-sided ratings."

The suspension of elections is due to marital being invoked where an election cannot be hosted per the constitution.

While polls can give a form of incite of how a group feels about a person, there have been many times where polls did not predict the outcome of an election.

Ukraine's constitution bans elections under martial law, in place since Russia's 2022 invasion. Martial law suspends elections for security, focusing on defense and war efforts. Elections now could aid Putin by weakening Ukraine‚Äôs defense and legitimizing Russian occupation

In 2019 Zelenskyy won a landslide victory with 73.22% of the vote. 

Article 19 of Ukraine‚Äôs ‚ÄúOn the Legal Regime of Martial Law‚Äù law, which complements the constitution, explicitly bans presidential, parliamentary, and local elections while martial law is in effect.

Community notes are working perfectly. "FIX" is a codename for censoring independent citizens who pointed out Elon Musk's links to Putin. Only now is Musk spreading the Russian disinformation that Putin has insisted on spreading for months about the Ukrainian elections.

Approval: Independent polls show Zelensky still enjoys support among Ukrainians.
