You cannot use grok as a source. If you want to write a community note then you need to find a verifiable source.

Zelenski did in fact and not the parliament extended the martial law making it impossible to hold elections. Only the president can declare martial law. 
Zelenski knew he would lose the elections.

"Community Notes cannot be gamed or manipulated and Elon is totally wrong!" 
This is exactly what gamed or manipulated Community Notes would say.

NNN - Musk is clearly expressing an opinion. Additionally, due to the community-based nature of community notes, it is possible for a large enough group to apply a factually incorrect note to a post.

The electron result in 2019 is completely irrelevant.

Musk is expressing his opinion on the state of community notes.

Just because something is part of the Ukranian constition, doesn't mean Musk has to agree. Furthermore, it may not be fully appropriate and can be changed.

Notes are corrupted (sometimes) huge accounts spam certain accounts and upvote each other and downvote anyone else,  making their accounts huge (1000+ rating) and reporting  doesnt work as it doesn't go through. Also when you call this out you get downvoted and blocked.

NNN, Elon is the owner of X and has access to data about community notes that isn't public. If he says it's happening, he's the most authoritative source. Everyone else is speculating it's a lie.

Ukraine's constitution bans elections under martial law, in place since Russia's 2022 invasion. Martial law suspends elections for security, focusing on defense and war efforts. Elections now could aid Putin by weakening Ukraine‚Äôs defense and legitimizing Russian occupation

In 2019 Zelenskyy won a landslide victory with 73.22% of the vote. 

Article 19 of Ukraine‚Äôs ‚ÄúOn the Legal Regime of Martial Law‚Äù law, which complements the constitution, explicitly bans presidential, parliamentary, and local elections while martial law is in effect.

Community notes are working perfectly. "FIX" is a codename for censoring independent citizens who pointed out Elon Musk's links to Putin. Only now is Musk spreading the Russian disinformation that Putin has insisted on spreading for months about the Ukrainian elections.

No manipulation can be done to Community Notes. A note would need enough contributors from different points of view to rate that note as helpful.
As per X, Community Notes is an open and transparent process with the algorithm being open source.

Elections: Ukraine‚Äôs constitution prohibits elections during martial law which is a legal framework. 
Approval: Independent polls show Zelensky still enjoys support among Ukrainians. 
Media: Temporary wartime broadcast consolidation ‚â† equivalent to total media control.

Under Ukraine‚Äôs constitution, it is not legal to hold national elections during a period of martial law. The martial law has been extended a few months at a time by the parliament, not by Zelensky.
