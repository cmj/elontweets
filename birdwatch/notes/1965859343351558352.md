there is no proof or evidence that the left wing politics  is the “party” of the murder. Influential person like Elon’s personal opinions require Community Note as his views are read by hundreds of millions.

Nothing is confirmed about the alleged shooter. Speculation is premature and disingenuous.

"A suspect was taken into custody, university officials said, while officers on the scene could not confirm if a suspect had been arrested or other details about the alleged shooter."

calm hillside lark note is not needed. The event took place in Utah Valley University, guns are completely illegal for civilians to have in school zones under the 1990 gun free school zone act.
