1969 was not 76 years ago.

1969 was 56 years ago.

The moon landing happened in July so it was 55 years ago as of today April 23rd 2025.

NNN. 66 years is not counting from today to 1969. They are talking about the first flight, in 1903, and the landing on the Moon in 1969. 66 years apart.

It is suggesting that by that exponential technological progression, we should've reached Mars already, if someone've wanted
