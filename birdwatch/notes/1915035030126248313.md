Yes, we can return to the Moon, as we are doing so in a few years with the Artemis mission. It is, however, extremely expensive, having cost the US almost $500 billion in today's dollar, back in the Apollo missions. The pretext was the Cold War. Today, there's none.

NNN. Picture shows Wright Brother's first flight in 1903 and moon landing in 1969. A factual difference of 66 years. 
Although 1969 was 56 years ago, a typo stating it was 76 years ago should have been noted in comment section as it does not change the posts overall point

The last crewed lunar mission was in December of 1972, 52 years ago. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_17

1969 was not 76 years ago.

1969 was 56 years ago.

The moon landing happened in July so it was 55 years ago as of today April 23rd 2025.

I agree that beyond the dates, what matters is the need to go to Mars and finally begin our departure from Earth
