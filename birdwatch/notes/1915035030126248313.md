Wright Brothers’ flight pictures were only released in 1908 AFTER Santos Dumont’s successful flight in front of thousands of people in Paris. Few friends as testimonies and only their own annotations corroborates their claim. Later attempts to replicate were unsuccessful.

Yes, we can return to the Moon, as we are doing so in a few years with the Artemis mission. It is, however, extremely expensive, having cost the US almost $500 billion in today's dollar, back in the Apollo missions. The pretext was the Cold War. Today, there's none.

NNN. Picture shows Wright Brother's first flight in 1903 and moon landing in 1969. A factual difference of 66 years. 
Although 1969 was 56 years ago, a typo stating it was 76 years ago should have been noted in comment section as it does not change the posts overall point

1969 was not 76 years ago.

1969 was 56 years ago.

The moon landing happened in July so it was 55 years ago as of today April 23rd 2025.

NNN: There is no conspiracy to suggest the Wright Brothers did not fly in 1903. They flew several times before DuPont and has been verified by lengthy documentation and witness accounts at the time they were achieved.

I agree that beyond the dates, what matters is the need to go to Mars and finally begin our departure from Earth
