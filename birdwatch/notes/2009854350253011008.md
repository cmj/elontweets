Misleading

The UK number refers to wider 'communications offences' not just online comments.

And few of these arrears lead to prosecutions let alone 'prison'.

The United States of America has more people in prison than any other country. The UK doesn't even make the top 10. https://x.com/i/status/2009893650319188022

#### NOT MISLEADING

NNN - Grok or any other LLM is not a reliable source.

Also, both Elon and the post quoted are specifically referencing arrests for speech, not general prison numbers.
