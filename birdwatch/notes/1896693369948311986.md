NNN.  AI prompts are not sources, and Musk is stating an opinion, not an official policy.

The money laundering accusation against Zelinskyy has never been proven false despite snopes claiming it comes from "Russian sympathizers". Research a man named Seymour Hersh and his investigative journaling. There has been no financial accounting provided by Ukraine.

Ukraine‚Äôs baalready a democracy. In 2019,Zelensky was democratically elected with 73%, winning every region but 1. He remains legitimate as the constitution forbids elections during martial law/ war he is still supported by a majority Ukrainians. Amnesty presupposes a crime https://biblioteka.sejm.gov.pl/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Ukraina_ang_010117.pdf

Zelensky is neither accused of any crime, nor has he been condemned by a court of law. Therefore no amnesty is needed.
