Important Context Missing:

While the post insinuates there are less white people, the number of white people has increased, comparing with the 1950s.

White population 1950 ~ 700 Million people

White population 2025 ~ 1.1 Billion people

Previous note not needed:
Writer missed the whole point 

While the white population itself did increase from 1950 -> 2025, which is  correctly stated on the note,

In comparison with the global population it has actually decreased significantly as has been showed on the post.
