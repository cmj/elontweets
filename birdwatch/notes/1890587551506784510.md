NNN - The author never said the pictures were from a current protest. It is said the protests are set to be on March. Therefore, there‚Äôs no misinformation.

The images used in the original post do not depict recent protests against President Lula. They are from demonstrations that took place in 2015-2016 against then-President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached in 2016.

The post Elon is sharing has photographs taken back in 2016 in a protest against then President Dilma Rousseff, not Lula.

Sharing outdated information that can br misleading is one of the reasons for getting a Community Note.
