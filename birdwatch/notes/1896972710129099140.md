[Tue Mar 04, 2025 17:15:12 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)„Äêùóï„Äë: @Anc_Aesthetics My statement is accurate that the rules are asymmetric.  Canadian banks can operate at scale in the US, but US banks are not allowed to operate at scale in Canada.

NNN  The OP is factual and the unnecessary CN just reinforced that American owned banks cannot be Schedule I, Canada's Big Six fall under the Schedule 1 category, meaning they must be Canadian-owned institutions that take deposits. Major disadvantages are placed on our banks. https://resourcehub.bakermckenzie.com/en/resources/global-financial-services-regulatory-guide/north-america/canada/topics/how-do-the-licensing-requirements-apply-to-cross-border-business-in-your-jurisdiction

US banks in Canada operate either as Schedule II or Schedule III entities.
Schedule II subsidiaries are subject to the same requirements as Canadian-owned banks.
Most US banks in Canada have chosen the Schedule III option as it does not subject them to the same requirements.

Additional context: Canadian banking is designed for stability over profitability. This legislation protects citizens assets from bank failures, and has been successful with only 2 bank closures in the last 102 years. For context, the US saw 569 closures from 2001-2025.
