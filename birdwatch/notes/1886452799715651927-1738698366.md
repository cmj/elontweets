Qualitative research cannot be generalized to the population as a whole. The studies cited don't validate or "prove" anything other than the thoughts and feelings of the study participants.

The post is not misleading. The proposed CNs are. Having been studied by science is not the same as being "backed" by science. "Gender fluid" is one of many, many "genders" on the diagram. These are not scientific, they're cultural/social constructs masquerading as science.

“Countless”…
It’s 6. I didn’t even run out of fingers. 

Also, not all of the studies even support the claims.

"Gender fluidity is backed up by countless scientific papers and research programs." Yeah, that's the problem. Scientists who don't worship your god risk losing funding. This isn't "scientific consensus", it's a mafia.

NNN.
All the sources are studies that focus on people who feel different from their biological sex to prove others points. This does not prove the scientific existence of gender fluidity.

NOTE NEEDED - Do not express personal opinions in notes! The post is FACTUALLY incorrect in the meaning it conveys. Gender fluidity IS a scientific concept and it is the object of many research papers. It is wrong to say that it is not science, regardless of personal beliefs.
