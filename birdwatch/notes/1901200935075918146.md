The quarter of a bllion dollar United States Agency for Global Media lease Kari Lake refers to in the quoted post is for 15 years, not per year.

Kari says its a 15 year lease for a quarter of a billion dollars. Thats about 16.6 Million USD per year, not quarter of a billion per year. It is inconceivable that an office building will be rented for 250 Mn USD per year.

Nnn, the contract is for 250 million for 15 years. No one claimed it was per year.
