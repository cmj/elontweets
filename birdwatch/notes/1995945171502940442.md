@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: @clembin0 @iliketeslas Skin tone is obvious to anyone who isn’t blind. Overwhelmingly, the vast majority of Jewish people look White! That’s just a fact. As for whether there is an actual underlying genetic difference, which ACTG sequences are the “Jewish ones” and why? Does anyone actually know?… https://t.co/zFb4rBK0hB | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1995945171502940442
