Claims about Haroon Aswat's release with "no monitoring" are misleading.

Although he cannot be released with GPS monitoring as per the UK's law against surveillance of psychiatric patients, sources confirmed he's expected to be under "robust monitoring" for up to 30 years

Although an UNNAMED source claims this terrorist will be “robustly” monitored, a NAMED Metro counterterrorism official is gravely concerned as Aswat is released, under a legal loophole (for claimed psychiatric issues) not permitting the monitoring done with other criminals.
