They are also mooching off other governments. [@profstonge] Legacy media is a tax-funded grift. DOGE finds nearly 5,000 media outlets funded by USAID alone — including Politico, New York Times, and even the BBC. At least $500 million fueling a worldwide industry of propaganda and censorship. https://t.co/ATLKPSQqwU | ↳ 2,509 ⇅ 14,147 ♥ 49,860 🡕 3,479,337 | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1889370367845859503

Elon Musk is one of the biggest beneficiaries of US
Government money. Both SpaceX and Tesla survived their early days thanks to government grants, subsidies, contracts and policies. In addition, he takes full advantage of tax loopholes for billionaires to pay minimal taxes.
