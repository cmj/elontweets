@elonmusk (Elon Musk): There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against ùïè.  We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved.  Tracing ‚Ä¶ [@cb_doge] First, protests against DOGE. Then, Tesla stores were attacked. Now, ùïè is down. I wouldn‚Äôt rule out the possibility that this downtime is the result of an attack on ùïè. | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1899149509407473825 (20 hours, 21 minutes ago)
