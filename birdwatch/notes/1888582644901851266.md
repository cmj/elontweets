NNN - Post is opinion informed by very recent factual discoveries. Current suggested note is dated opinion informed by nothing.

NNN: note above is both partisan and irrational. The link provided is from an organisation funded by a number of clearly left leaning organizations including Open Society - which has worked hard and spent billions establishing its network of likeminded government employees.

The post is about a kleptocracy not a valid beneficial relationship. The misdirection is exemplary of misuse of CN.

Kleptocracy is essentially thievery.

Elon Musk is one of the biggest beneficiaries of US Government money. Both SpaceX and Tesla survived their early days thanks to government grants, subsidies, contracts and policies. In addition, he takes full advantage of tax loopholes for billionaires to pay minimal taxes.

The evidence shows kleptocracy is another stage of a lack of intellectual honesty wielded by those in control at any one point  in time. Every facet of our system is geared to the most successful manipulators vs honesty and values.
