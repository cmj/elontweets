You guys can't just mark everything with 
"NNN - opinion"

Objectivly implies this is a fact, [1][2] not an opinion, that would be subjectively. [3][4] Simple grammar.
Learn the difference.

Mr. Elon Musk paid the president of the United States an extra $100 million to do an ad for Tesla in presence of the media with the whole world watching in the white house. This was done in an attempt to boost the failing stock price at the time.
