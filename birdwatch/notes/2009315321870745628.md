His point is imprecisely stated.

It is not because Elon is white, but functionally due to his large personal ownership stake in the company making it highly unlikely to meet South African legal requirements without broad, aggressive ownership affirmative action measures.

The claim is misleading. Apartheid laws enforced explicit racial oppression. Post-1994 race-referencing laws are constitutional remedial measures, not equivalent to apartheid. Comparing the two by counting laws is not a sound legal analysis.

BBBEE act requires Starlink to include Blacks and Indians throughout the company. It has nothing to do with him being a Boer.

Per Grok: "Starlink isn't licensed in South Africa yet due to B-BBEE laws requiring 30% ownership by historically disadvantaged groups or equivalent investments. Musk's claim it's solely because he's not Black oversimplifies; it's about company compliance, not personal race."

Man kann den südafrikanischen BEE Act, durchaus als Wirtschaftsrassismus verstehen, denn er benachteiligt in diesem Fall das Unternehmen Starlink aufgrund der Hautfarbe und Herkunft von Elon Musk, wobei er nur 42% Anteile besitzt.

Musk has a 42% controlling share of SpaceX., which owns Starlink.

If "historically disadvantaged groups" pony up sufficient investment and buy in to meet the 30% mandate, fine. Otherwise, it is attempted extortion of massive value.
Musk's statement is simple, but accurate.

NNN. Firstly, Grok isn't a trustworthy source for a community note. But also your note literally backs up Musks claim- the 'historically disadvantaged groups' are black people.  Therefore it is Musks personal race that prevents him getting a licence.

NNN. The proposed note shows that Elon is correct; the "company compliance" issue is precisely that not enough owners of SpaceX are black. As the owner of ~50% SpaceX (the rest being mostly employees and institutions), that means Elon.
