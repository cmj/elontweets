If it is true (as the left constantly claims) that any criticism of Ukraine is love of Russia, then it follows that waving Ukraine flags in congress is hate of America.

NNN - Elon Musk is allowed to share the opinion of 70% of the country and to share that opinion. He's entitled to have any opinion, shared or not. If you disagree, do so in the comments. CN is not the place to throw a tantrum.

NNN - It's an opinion and he points out it was the only thing they cheered for.

US has signed the Budapest Memorandum to defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. Ukraine paid with thousands of its nuclear bombs in the 1990s to obtain that guarantee.

Defending Ukraine is in line with upholding that written agreement.

This post is a perfect example of a false dichotomy. Waving a Ukrainian flag or showing support for another country does not necessarily translates into hatred for America. https://www.logical-fallacy.com/articles/false-dilemma/

Hate generates lies and lies generate hate, the propaganda that @ElonMusk is spreading through this social media generates hate based on ideologies and national origin.

@ElonMusk is a racist and a dangerous person with power on this world.
