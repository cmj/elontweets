NNN. Everything in the post above is personal opinion and whether or not the plans to sunset the ISS were known previously is irrelevant.

The OP states that its time to "prepare".  What SpaceX's plans for preparation is unknown, but known to its CEO.
Take all arguments to the comments section.

It's not a fresh news that ISS is planned to end its operational life in 2030. SpaceX already obtained a contract for constructing the deorbiting vehicle in June 2024.

Elon Musk tries to play around this once again.
