This statement was fed to Grok and analyzed for truth, and found to be a divisive statement.  Notes are needed as followers of this account might perceive this misinformation based in opinion as a fact due to the author's reach.

Judges are not meant to follow popular opinion—they uphold the Constitution. As Hamilton wrote in Federalist 78, judicial independence protects justice. Removing judges over rulings invites tyranny.

Botanical Vine Grebe's note implying that Grok has authority over the philosophical and political speech in the original post is disturbing. It claims that users are endangered by an opinion that might not reflect Grok's interpretation. This is not what CN's are for.

Elon is not at all implying that judges should bend to public opinion. Current proposed note must be reading a completely different post or is really digging for a reason to put a community note on him. No note needed.

NNN - The 100 is purely Musk's opinion to a post that is being quoted. Any notes regarding claims in the original post should be proposed there.
