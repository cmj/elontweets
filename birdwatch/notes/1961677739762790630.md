It is not a leaderboard, it's a usage chart.
Here is the leaderboard, Claude Sonnet 4 is in the 1st place, Grok Code Fast 1 is on the 4th.

NO NOTE NEEDED: 

Whoever the clown was who made the community note selected "week" instead of day on the leaderboard. 

Elon Musk's post is 100% factual if you look at "day" in the leaderboard. Grok Code Fast has not been out for a week yet. 

Stop abusing community notes!

It says leaderboard on the top left. Usage charts can also be ranked in a leaderboard, the original post is not incorrect.
