Otherwise, you can scale GDP artificially high by spending money on things that don‚Äôt make people‚Äôs lives better.  For example, you could shift everyone who is building cars to working at the DMV. That would‚Ä¶ [@Geiger_Capital] Holy shit. Atlanta Fed is now projecting that Q1 GDP will be -1.5%‚Ä¶ a contraction.

The CN appears to be addressing the quoted post, not the post it has been place on. It should be redirected to the quoted post. Additionally, it is incorrect, as the GDPNow analysis includes government spending.

Simon Kuznets warned against GDP being used in its simplest form for this very reason.  He said gov spending should not be included.  

OP statement is factual in that GDP can be manipulated by government actors.

However NNN because this is an opinion piece.

The US government's spending has a very small impact on GDP.

This tweet misleads about GDP. The Q1 GDPNow estimate projects declines in exports (-3.29%) and consumer spending (-1.0%), not government spending (-0.01%). This is a forecast, not confirmed data. Economists already analyze GDP components separately.
