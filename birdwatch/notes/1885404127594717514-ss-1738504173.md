NNN- a CN for EM's response to a CN is completely unnecessary and childish. If you want to dispute the CN, take it to the OG CN. Start citing sources that are bipartisan and read the executive actions. Do your research by use primary sources, not just secondary sources

NNN Trump's changes to aviation wouldn't have had an impact on the crash since there was too little time for the changes to have an effect, as stated by aviation experts.

NNN. Musk's post simply comments on CN. The suggested CNs belong on the quoted post. However, they are not needed on OP either.  There was no freeze on hiring of ATCs, and even if there was, it would not have affected current crash under investigation.

NNN.  

"The White House clarified that the hiring freeze did not apply to air traffic control due to its role in public safety, and air traffic controllers are not typically replaced with changes in administration."

Per MSN and Newsweek:

"Trump's order does not apply to military personnel or positions related to immigration enforcement, national security, or public safety."

NNN. The NYT is not a reputable news source as they’ve been known to lie more than they tell the truth.

Calm Sea Kestrel
1) no hiring freeze at atc 
2)  email  not addressed specifically to ATC but to all federal employees as a FAQ at their request for details before deadline of 2/6/25. thus  timeliness of the faq memo 
3) no evidence ATC was understaffed at Regan

Donald Trump's federal hiring freeze was branded 'dangerous' and a risk to aviation safety just days before an American Airlines plane collided midair with a Black Hawk helicopter.
