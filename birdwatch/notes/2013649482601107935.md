Jack Lang had planned a protest and to burn a Quran, he was met with counter protesters that assaulted and chased him, he jumped into a woman's car at a red light for safety. The crowd was not targeting conservatives in cars, they were chasing Jack Lang.

Antifa has history is attacking conservatives. Fact is Mobs of Leftist extremist trying to attack cars which they think have conservatives inside and breaking law. this is tactics used by Antifa and far left to threaten conservative so they don't cover their riots.

misleading. This is from a rally led by conservative activist Jake Lang (pardoned Jan 6 rioter) Lang was assaulted by counter-protesters. The car wasn’t random—it picked up Lang to escape; the crowd targeted it amid clashes, not mere suspicion of conservatism source grok.com

The poster just called out the violent act as “terrible,” so that off-base Community Note isn’t needed.  
If you want to talk about ideology, do it under the original post.  
And using violence just because someone thinks differently from you is a crime.

NNN. Copying and pasting your explanation of events is NOT CN worthy and should be reported. 
All of these belong in the comments

NNN - Poster gives a one word OPINION.

If you want to debate the accuracy of the tweet he is commenting on, then do it on the original.
