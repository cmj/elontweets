NNN --Zelenskyy has said both.

Noteworthy Summer Bullfinch's links to Zelenskyy saying he wants peace are correct; however,  AP news has a video from 9 hours ago where he indeed says the end of the war is very very far away. He says this at the 1:21 mark : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0n3bixqt7A

For proposed CNs: Your opinion is not a Community Note. It is a comment, just like everyone else's opinion.

NNN - The AP has reported this statement from Zelensky.  Trump and Musk are stating an opinion based on that statement.

NNN, absolutely. Stop abusing CN and hide in CN with your bias, take it to the comment section and let the world see and debate it.

Clearly, President Trump is trying to broker the deal. It is obvious that he has internal knowledge of the situation. Also, Elon Musk is a chosen advisor. He gave his own opinion. NO community note needed

NNN. Zelesnkyy saying he wants something obviously does not prove that he actually wants it.

Zelensky didn't say that. He said, accd to translation, which could also be slightly inaccurate or misleading: "AN AGREEMENT to end the war is still vry, vry far away, & no one has started all these steps yet." This is completely different. Timescales vary accd to context too.

The note of noteworthy summer bullfinch is correct.

You guys really need to stop spamming 'NNN, opinion' to Community Notes. Opinions can still be based on incorrect information and/or benefit from additional context. 

Don't be biased.

This is not true. Zelenskyy has repeatedly called for peace as soon as possible. Experts are worried that the one-month "air and energy" ceasefire proposed by France's Macron would allow Russia to "re-arm, regroup and reinvade." Ukraine is advocating for lasting peace.
