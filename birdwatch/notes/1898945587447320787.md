[Mon Mar 10, 2025 03:54:43 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: Biden’s own @USGAO estimated fraud at up to half a trillion dollars! [@PalmerLuckey] Democrats paint fraudulent spending as like voter fraud - it happens, but rarely.  Trump talking about hundreds of billions in fraud is dismissed as "without evidence". Biden's own GAO estimated fraudulent spending at $233B to $521B per year!  Just fraud, not even waste/abuse. | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1898945587447320787

The GAO is an independent, non-partisan government agency. It was not "Biden's"

The comment is splitting hairs. The post is plainly referring to the Government Accountability Office during the Biden administration. The partisan or nonpartisan nature of the office has no bearing on this post.
