Urine tests are the easiest to tamper with (Diluting urine samples, using urine from someone else, using synthetic urine, etc.)

No way of knowing if Elon Musk’s actual urine was the specimen tested.

Illicit drug use rarely shows up on a urinalysis if the user abstains for 30 days, usually a bit less. This test merely confirms that Elon abstained for awhile. A hair follicle test, as required for many jobs requiring a clearance, would be far  more conclusive. https://www.labcorp.com/organizations/capabilities/employee-testing-wellness/pre-employment-drug-testing/hair-drug-testing

NN - Elon took this drug test in response to a news article which came out 2 weeks ago, adding context about how long these drugs stay detectable makes sense. 

Tweets do not exist in a contextless void my NNN brothers. You actually do have to think a little bit.

Urinalysis results for the majority of drugs are only detectable within 7 days (shorter for many, potentially longer for cannabis). This test only confirms that Elon Musk has not consumed any of these drugs from around the start of June, and has no relevance for any time prior

NNN. Elon has been subjected to RANDOM drug tests due to SpaceX for years and has never failed. NYT's report refuting the randomness according to "an insider" is just laughable.

nnn. 

No claims were made about how long a drug stays within the system. 

Though it is foolish to post medical identifying information, you can’t hipaa yourself.

Note is not needed on a personal opinion post.
 
The test result sheet is factual and self-explanatory.

The OP didn’t claim anything further. 

All notes belong in the comment section.
