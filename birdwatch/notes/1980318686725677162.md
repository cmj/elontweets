NNN, it's essentially true. While NG-1 did get to orbit, no payload was deployed. A "Blue Ring Pathfinder" was originally going to be launched, but wasn't ready. What they now call blue ring pathfinder was probably only a comms module, and was not deployed in a meaningful sense https://www.blueorigin.com/missions/ng-1
