Inputting this exact prompt into the ChatGPT App, in dark mode, on an iPhone, on ChatGPT Pro, it returns Sam Altman

There could be more prompts prior to this which convinces the model to choose Musk, but we can't see them, so this post is not definitively true at this point

NNN. An LLM like ChatGPT produces answers based on chance. 10 questions written the same way may all receive different responses. If you wish to argue this response is more or less likely (or argue about anything, really), do so in the comments not CN.

Reminder to CNs: LLMs are stochastic so you can not “reproduce” the post. GPT-5 will answer a binary question involving a value judgement differently each time.

You would need to sample thousands of interactions to have any confidence in what other users might experience.

NNN. don't counter speculation with more speculation.
