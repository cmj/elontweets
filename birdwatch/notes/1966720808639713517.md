"Raven Samuelson" is not a real person. This was a parody/rage-baiting account.

Their profile picture is stolen from a real person: https://web.archive.org/web/20200701033451/https://transgenderlawcenter.org/programs/black-trans-circles

Their account posted crude content in an attempt to stir up drama: https://web.archive.org/web/20250912031928/https://bsky.app/profile/ravensamuelson.bsky.social

Charlie Kirk was shot by a Groyper who supported further right politics than Charlie did which they tracked and criticized him on social media for years prior.

The account is still owned by a human. The post and rhetoric are created by a human who is responsible for what they say. It dose strip responsibility.

Post is opinion - notes don’t belong on opinion 

No evidence shooter was a Groyper. 

This theory is mind bogglingly stupid. The shooter expressed that Kirk was too hateful. A groyper would say he wasn’t hateful enough
