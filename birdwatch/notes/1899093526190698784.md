Senator Kelly is a decorated veteran and astronaut. To be a traitor you need to aid and abet an enemy or adversary. Ukraine is not our enemy, and supporting Ukraine with aid and moral support is not treason.

Kelly: US Navy aviator flew 39 combat missions, earning Flying Cross + Air Medal. Selected by NASA in ‘96, he commanded Space Shuttle missions.

Ukraine: US ally, not at war with US. Supported by US (RU sanctioned) so Kelly isn’t a traitor for supporting them.

A "traitor" is one who betrays a country, friend, principle etc. Capt. Mark Kelly, USN (Ret.)'s support for Ukraine is a demonstration of commitment to democratic values and American allies. There is no reasonable way to portray this as traitorous.
