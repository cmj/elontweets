False, it’s not a test. It’s a tweet.

NNN. Elon hasn’t specified what kind of test he is running & this is now a post, it’s not a tweet anymore. If you have comments on history post, please put them where they belong, not in CN.

Block their IPS & have someone take their phones away. This tweet does not need a community note. These people are abusing what a Community Note is for. I put this here cause all your employees are AI

Community Notes have gotten out of hand and those abusing the system need to be removed. I am only noting so myself because we see a barrage of noters calling out others by name leaving us to pour through these as well. Please use link “Report Community Note” Thank you

NNN To explain that "this is a tweet" is gratuitous excess palaver and has no place in Community Notes. Abusers of CN should be relegated to Blue Sky or the Inferno. They clog up a functioning machine.

NNN 
Elon is conducting a test for community notes. Community notes failed. 
Elon said nothing that required a note. He was baiting the community note community to prove you community note him on every post.
Stop harassing and abusing community notes.
