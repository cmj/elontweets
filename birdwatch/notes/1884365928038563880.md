The Starliner crew launched to space in June 2024. It was supposed to be a ten day mission. They still have not returned.  Who to blame is an opinion. No note needed.

The astronauts are indeed stranded. And while SpaceX has had the ability to retrieve them all along, the Biden administration declines to ask for that help. That it is considered a terrible decision is Musk's personal opinion.

NNN - Biden admin requested them to be returned and set a date of March or April. 

Trump has requested SpaceX make it a priority to get them home sooner as stated in the post.

Not every joke Elon makes needs a note. Stop abusing the system.

If you're going to be pedantic, at least make the note equally as funny as the post itself.

NNN - No one said it was new news. It simply states a request made by the President. Linking to a news story about the astronauts and not the information actually stated in the post is useless.

Butch & Suni’s return was arranged with SpaceX in August last year. They will return via the SpaceX Crew-9 in February 2025, part of routine mission rotations, not an emergency. The delay aligns with the readiness of Crew Dragon C213 for the Crew-10 mission in March 2025.

NASA made the plan for their return back in September 2024 and Crew-9 launched on September 28th with just 2 astronauts instead of 4. The plan is for them to return after Crew-10 arrives and no changes to that plan has been announced by NASA.

The two Astronauts are "stranded" because of (1) technical issues of the Boeing spacecraft that brought them up, and (2) delays in providing the SpaceX spacecraft C213 that must launch before C212 can bring them down. Solely Boeing and SpaceX are responsible for that.

The two astronauts referenced are not stranded. Since the arrival of the Crew-9 Dragon mission, they have a safe ride home.

The plan is for Crew-9 to remain on station until Crew-10 arrives which is more practical for NASA.

This was established when Biden was still president.

@Potus request is correct. 

The innuendo that Biden admin is at fault for astronauts being stranded is false - actually is Musk that didn't have the SpaceX Dragon Crww-9 capsule ready when the return was planned months ago.

Musk and SpaceX cannot return the stranded astronauts home sooner than the date agreed upon during the Biden Administration due to NASA safety protocols. They may only return home after the arrival of the Crew-10 mission.

Suni and Butch, the astronauts that flew on Starliner, are currently scheduled to return after the arrival of Crew 10 in late March. The standard process for crew rotations on the ISS. The only delay in the current schedule is the testing of a new SpaceX Dragon capsule.

The two astronauts that are “stranded” have been assigned to return on a SpaceX Dragon vehicle since the Biden administration. The decision to return on Crew Dragon was made by NASA prior to Trump being elected, it was made in August 2024

President Biden had nothing to do with delaying the astronauts return flight. NASA and SpaceX want to make sure that the Crew-10s Dragon is ready for flight and want to have a handoff between the crew on the station and the next crew.
