@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: The radical left has been using fraudulent government programs for a long time to import and retain vast numbers of illegal (and legal, in some cases) immigrants to win elections and turn America into a single-party state, destroying any real democracy.

Australia has always been governed by centre right & centre left governments. Immigration under the “radical left” is therefore effectively zero.

False claims: 3, per fact-checks from PolitiFact, NPR, and others—no evidence of fraudulent programs for voter importation, minimal non-citizen voting (e.g., 0.00028% in MI 2024), and Somali resettlement in MN was legal, not engineered for Omar's election.

When he had problems with Trump, Musk wanted to found the “America Party.” At the time, he claimed that we were living in a one-party system characterized by corruption. In a post that has since been deleted, he admitted: “Without me, Trump would have lost the election.”

O post alega fraude eleitoral via imigração sem provas. Em casos reais, como o de Ilhan Omar (MN), ela venceu por 193 mil votos, enquanto a população de origem somali no estado era de apenas ~58 mil, sendo numericamente impossível alterar o resultado.

In 2018, Ilhan Omar won by 193,263 votes (267,703 total). 2018 Census data estimated the total Somali ancestry population in all of MN at ~58,800. 
Even if all were eligible voters in her district, they represent less than 31% of her victory margin.

Ilhan Omar won her first election by 193,263 votes. There were about 94,000 Somalis in all MN at that time. Even if all were registered in her district and voted, this was not a majority of her support.

One of the evidence included was the significant win in the general election for Omar. However, what it counts in blue districts are the primaries. In the 2024 primary for district 5, the difference was not so significant: Omar 68K, Samuel 52K.

A note is not needed because this is an opinion post. Proposed notes are also disagreeing opinions. Notes proposing that a voting block of only ~+30% cannot influence an election are obviously incorrect on the face of it.

The first note about Omar winning.  You can win the Democrat primary with a lot less votes. Once your on the ticket some people vote blue no matter who
