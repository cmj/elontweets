@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: @MatthewBerman No, I never said that. I told everyone who asked in the beginning that I thought the probability of OpenAI beating Google was ~1%. Infinitely different from 0%. After the DotA win, I raised the win probability to ~10%. | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1970745523641688396

Contx from emails: Feb 1, 2018 "Even then, the probability of being a counterweight to Google is small. It just isn't zero"
Dec 26, 2018 "My probability assessment of OpenAI being relevant to DeepMind/Google [without a dramatic change] in execution and resources is 0%. Not 1%"

In a 2018 email to OpenAI leadership, Elon said the chance of them being relevant to Google was 0%.

OpenAI did change direction and got more resources. The conditional of Elon's "if no change ? 0%, else 1%" thus evaluates to the 1% he states here. NNN
