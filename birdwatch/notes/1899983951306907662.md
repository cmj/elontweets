Non-citizens, including undocumented immigrants, are prohibited from voting in New York state and federal elections, as these rights are reserved exclusively for U.S. citizens.

NNN. Regardless of what kind of elections illegals can vote for in NY, they can still vote. The overall claim he is making is that Democrats are trying to turn the country blue by using immigrants. This is his opinion and should be argued in the comments section. https://www.foxnews.com/politics/800000-noncitizens-could-soon-voting-new-york-citys-elections

As stated at the end of this article, several districts do allow non-citizens to vote. And the issue in New York is going through the courts. New York democrats are trying to allow it.

While legal residents and refugees (immigrants) cannot vote upon arrival, they will have the opportunity to apply for citizenship in 5 years. It may take a bit longer for refugees, but it would only take two presidential terms for them to be put on the voter rolls.

Note by Dexterous Tide Penguin misses the key point. It's true that non-citizens are prohibited from voting in New York state and federal elections, but this is precisely why it is illegal if they are allowed to vote.
