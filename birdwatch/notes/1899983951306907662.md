The claim that "In NY State illegal aliens can already vote in state and city elections" is false. Though NY City grant municipal voting rights to noncitizens, the law approved by the city council was never implemented due to a legal challenge. https://apnews.com/article/voting-noncitizens-new-york-lawsuit-2c56f12fb0e62a3ed978b9346d6aaab6

There are multiple statements contained within this clip that are highly contested including illegals ability to vote, FEMA funding, & entitlement fraud. A best practice is for you to do your own research and draw your own conclusions as additional evidence emerges.

Regardless of whether you like Elon and Joe or not, factually the claim that there are 600 illegals registered to vote in the State of NY is wrong. Just ask Grok.

Note needed. Saying it's his personal opinion defeats the purpose of most community notes. Elon Musk is a person with vast political influence who works in governance. Thus, this should not merely be seen as a personal opinion but rather one of the government he represents.

Non-citizens, including undocumented immigrants, are prohibited from voting in New York state and federal elections, as these rights are reserved exclusively for U.S. citizens.

NNN. Regardless of what kind of elections illegals can vote for in NY, they can still vote. The overall claim he is making is that Democrats are trying to turn the country blue by using immigrants. This is his opinion and should be argued in the comments section. https://www.foxnews.com/politics/800000-noncitizens-could-soon-voting-new-york-citys-elections

As stated at the end of this article, several districts do allow non-citizens to vote. And the issue in New York is going through the courts. New York democrats are trying to allow it.

While legal residents and refugees (immigrants) cannot vote upon arrival, they will have the opportunity to apply for citizenship in 5 years. It may take a bit longer for refugees, but it would only take two presidential terms for them to be put on the voter rolls.

Note by Dexterous Tide Penguin misses the key point. It's true that non-citizens are prohibited from voting in New York state and federal elections, but this is precisely why it is illegal if they are allowed to vote.
