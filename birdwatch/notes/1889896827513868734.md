To address the top note regarding ‚ÄúThomson Reuters‚Äù: Thomson purchased Reuters News in 2007. The website they direct to is simply another brand of the Thomson company. Reuters news is owned by the same ‚ÄúThomson‚Äù company. 

NNN the post is factually correct.

NNN. Accurate.

Thomson Reuters offers various special services, including financial & legal information, in addition to its news division, Reuters News. Reuters News is a division of Thomson Reuters, providing news coverage globally.

NNN. Even if ‚Äúnefarious-sounding titles are instead programs aimed to improve user security, and not to deceive the public through social engineering‚Äù, there‚Äôs no evidence presented which proves that is the case with this program. Further discussion of merit belongs in comments.

NNN. the only job of the media is to report facts. Not participate in countering narratives. If a large media house is being paid millions by the government for this purpose, they are no longer objective and should have disclosed this. Stop pretending this is normal.

In 2008 Reuters merged with Canadian electronic publisher Thomson Corporation to form Thomson Reuters, though in its reporting capacity the company was still commonly referred to as Reuters.

Misleading:
"Social Engineering Defense" is protecting a computer network against intrusion by social engineering.

Example: someone on the phone pretending to be with your employer's help desk, asking you for your password.

It has nothing to do with manipulating society.

Elon is framing that the news organisation Reuters is getting that money which is false. Just because it has Reuters in its name does not mean that it goes to the news organisation. On top of that it started in 2018 when Trump was president. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14393629/donald-trump-reuters-payment-pentagon-social-deception-study.html

This "large scale social deception" contract was:

* first awarded under Trump
* paid to Reuters' data division, not the newsroom
* for researching *defenses* against deception
* not revealed by "DOGE investigations"; was a public record, visible online for many years

Deze subsidie was voor bescherming van consumentenbelangen via een dochterorganisatie van Reuters en gaat niet over informatie be√Ønvloeding. Trump heeft deze subsidie gestart. https://x.com/mkeulemans/status/1889974458049548328?s=46&t=TjFpCfw9ZR2zzKoTaKZDyg

This is misleading. The missing context is that these nefarious-sounding titles are instead programs aimed to improve user security, and not to deceive the public through social engineering. One of the programs even has the word 'Defense' in the title.
