NNN. Even if ‚Äúnefarious-sounding titles are instead programs aimed to improve user security, and not to deceive the public through social engineering‚Äù, there‚Äôs no evidence presented which proves that is the case with this program. Further discussion of merit belongs in comments.

NNN. the only job of the media is to report facts. Not participate in countering narratives. If a large media house is being paid millions by the government for this purpose, they are no longer objective and should have disclosed this. Stop pretending this is normal.

This is misleading. The missing context is that these nefarious-sounding titles are instead programs aimed to improve user security, and not to deceive the public through social engineering. One of the programs even has the word 'Defense' in the title.
