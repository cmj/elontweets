NNN, personal opinion.

Elon is not saying that judges can never overturn laws or unlawful orders. He's expressing an opinion on district court judges who are too trigger-happy with nationwide injunctions.

NNN as to the first note, the Constitution says the judiciary, which means the Supreme Court. The post is about lower court judges. If you're not a lawyer, don't share something you don't understand. Take note of the difference.

NNN - Harmonious Peat Peacock seems to be proving his own note isn't needed. If EVERY order can be blocked, then that constitutes a filter that dictates what is and isn't executive power, and can reasonably act as coercion to make the President restructure proposed orders.

NNN - 2018 Trump v. Hawaii SCOTUS:
“These injunctions did not emerge until a century and a half after the founding. And they appear to be inconsistent with longstanding limits on equitable relief and the power of Article III courts.”

The U.S. Constitution explicitly grants judges the power to block executive orders that violate the law or Constitution. This is a fundamental part of the separation of powers, designed to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful.

Democracy can coexist (and has for decades) with the possibility of district judges issuing nationwide injunctions. This dynamic (while maybe not optimal) has existed for a very long time and has not led to tyranny of the judiciary.
