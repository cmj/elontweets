NNN, personal opinion.

Elon is not saying that judges can never overturn laws or unlawful orders. He's expressing an opinion on district court judges who are too trigger-happy with nationwide injunctions.

NNN as to the first note, the Constitution says the judiciary, which means the Supreme Court. The post is about lower court judges. If you're not a lawyer, don't share something you don't understand. Take note of the difference.

NNN - Harmonious Peat Peacock seems to be proving his own note isn't needed. If EVERY order can be blocked, then that constitutes a filter that dictates what is and isn't executive power, and can reasonably act as coercion to make the President restructure proposed orders.

NNN - 2018 Trump v. Hawaii SCOTUS:
‚ÄúThese injunctions did not emerge until a century and a half after the founding. And they appear to be inconsistent with longstanding limits on equitable relief and the power of Article III courts.‚Äù

How do you leave CN again? I'm so sick of idiots using CN as a platform for their views. X.com, please please can we remove these dolts from CN. Like a three strikes you are out? You have to get a type of credit to join CN, just reverse that based on acceptance of the note.

As per Dershowitz, on the question of birth right citizenship, the Supreme Court will eventually rule against Trump. But legal actions to block Trump on how to spend money approved by Congress will fail. Elon is right. https://www.youtube.com/live/o1EetB4EY-E?si=TUhjMw4T4KWDXvSZ

Musk writes ‚ÄùEVERY Presidential order‚Äù, the word every means all Presidential orders, even those that NOT violate the law or Constitution.

This statement relies on oversimplification and emotional rhetoric rather than an accurate depiction of the U.S. legal system. Judicial checks on executive power are a hallmark of democracy, not tyranny.

The U.S. Constitution explicitly grants judges the power to block executive orders that violate the law or Constitution. This is a fundamental part of the separation of powers, designed to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful.

Democracy can coexist (and has for decades) with the possibility of district judges issuing nationwide injunctions. This dynamic (while maybe not optimal) has existed for a very long time and has not led to tyranny of the judiciary.
