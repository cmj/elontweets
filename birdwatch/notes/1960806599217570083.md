There is no “pattern” of trans people committing mass shootings at higher rates. Secret Service reports show mass shootings are overwhelmingly committed by whites (52%) and men (97%), not trans people.

Elon Musk acquired Twitter to utilize as his personal propaganda platform, aiming to influence global politics. This is propaganda. Watchdogs in multiple countries, along with peer-reviewed studies and leading universities, confirm this.

Mr. Musk's statement is not supported by evidence. 
Grok - after reviewing data on multiple school shootings - confirms there is no correlation between transgender identity and school shootings, but rather the opposite is true.

Going back several decades is inappropriate as transgenderism is much more prevalent more recently.

School mass shootings is too narrow as all mass shootings should be considered. 

In light of those two points, Musk is indeed correct as show in this post:

I put a graph in the comments, where such replies belong, showing a high rate of shootings by Trans on a per capita basis. There are very few trans people yet they are notably appearing in the news.

This is an anecdotal personal opinion.

If you disagree, go argue in the comments.

CN is only for correcting blatant misinformation.

When referring to shootings at Catholic or Christian schools there is a pattern. This is the 3rd Religious school shooting by a Trans Gender in the last 2 years. The pattern he refers to is a pattern of Trans attacking Religious schools and children, while also leaving manifestos

We're not talking about gang wars or the like. School shootings are the obvious focus here, and for them, there is not a huge amount of data, but enough to start to see see an unfortunate pattern:

Elon does not specify the pattern to which he is referring.

Other CN’s are assuming Elon’s intent based on personal biases.

This is opinion, and nothing more.

Stop abusing community notes to enforce your own opinion.

Grok is not a suitable resource, it can be factually wrong and depends on the prompt. Provide original data or don’t CN.

Elon Musk highlights a subtrend of transgender shooters (e.g., Nashville 2023, Minneapolis 2025) within school shootings—a trend nonetheless.

Most are cisgender men (97.7%, Reuters 2023), with 75% bullied (U.S. Secret Service).
