It is important to note the poll specifically about American politics can be voted on by any X user, and may not be representative of the current views of the American voter base.

This is 80% of X users who follow Musk or got this poll through the algorithm. Non-US users were also able to vote. This does not represent the 80% in the middle (USA).

I'm not a US citizen, but I voted YES because I believe US politics needs a strong alternative to the two dominant parties - democrats and republicans. Still, my vote, and those of other non-US citizens, shouldn’t count.

No note needed. 

This is factually true. Stop abusing community notes.

I'm normally for the nnn crowd but Elon is indirectly insinuating that the 80% of respondents were relevant to American politics and the above note stating other nations and only x users is correct to adds important context.   Not everybody uses X.  Not everybody is a US citizen.

NNN - The post never claims that the 80% are representative of any group, the post is factually cortect. Stop missusing notes.
