Jury pools in Michigan draw from driver's licenses/state IDs (available to non-citizens) and voter rolls, so non-citizens can be summoned without being voters. Of 239 non-citizens identified in Macomb County, only 14 were registered voters, with 3-4 having voted. https://www.macombdaily.com/2026/01/13/macomb-clerk-discovers-three-noncitizens-who-voted/ https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/macomb/2026/01/13/macomb-county-clerk-noncitizens-circuit-court-jury-pool/88143461007/

The post assumes jury pool presence means voter registration. This is false. Michigan jury pools come from driver's license databases, not voter rolls. Clerk Forlini confirmed only 14 of the 239 non-citizens were ever registered to vote. https://notthebee.com/article/viral-now-michigan-clerk-says-239-aliens-were-found-in-his-countys-jury-pool-in-just-four-months-

Michigan jury pools are drawn from driver's license/state ID lists (including non-citizens), not voter registration. Jury summons do not imply voting eligibility. In Macomb County, only 14 of 239 non-citizens in the jury pool over 4 months had ever registered to vote.

Of the 239 found on the voter roll, only 14 were actually registered to vote, as set forth in the article and the picture of the letter from the County Registrar.

Individuals without legal immigration status cannot obtain a standard Michigan driver's license. 

Which means, there are loopholes in the states in DMV, allowing illegals to obtain driver's license, which allows them to use it to vote or be selected in Jury trial.

Proposed note is comically terrifying in its justification- framing 'only' 14/239 foreign citizens as registered to vote attempts to lessen the severity of the OP point.

OP did not say 'all' were registered to vote- just 'they'. Proposed note confirms this. NNN
