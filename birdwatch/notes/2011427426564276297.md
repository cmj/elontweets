Michigan jury pools are selected from driver's license records, not voter rolls. Of the 239 non-citizens identified in Macomb County's jury pool, only 14 had ever been registered to vote. https://www.macombgov.org/departments/clerk-register-deeds/news/macomb-county-clerk-alarmed-about-citizenship-affecting-jury

Of the 239 found on the voter roll, only 14 were actually registered to vote, as set forth in the article and the picture of the letter from the County Registrar.

Individuals without legal immigration status cannot obtain a standard Michigan driver's license. 

Which means, there are loopholes in the states in DMV, allowing illegals to obtain driver's license, which allows them to use it to vote or be selected in Jury trial.

Proposed note is comically terrifying in its justification- framing 'only' 14/239 foreign citizens as registered to vote attempts to lessen the severity of the OP point.

OP did not say 'all' were registered to vote- just 'they'. Proposed note confirms this. NNN
