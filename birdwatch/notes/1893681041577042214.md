California has faced significant budget problems over the last two years—by our estimate, a $27 billion deficit in 2023‑23 and a $55 billion deficit in 2024‑25 (excluding early action taken this year)

NNN- Elon's post is an opinion and does not express that they have a budget deficit.

CA does have severe debt "California has twice the total liabilities of any other state. California had $498 billion in total liabilities at the end of fiscal year 2022."

The independent LAO found California’s budget is balanced.

“In November, we found that the underlying condition of the state’s budget was roughly balanced. This remains true under the Governor’s budget.”
