White Anglo Saxon British Government sent about 1.6 Million people from the Indian Subcontinent to other British colonies as Indentured Labourers from 1820-1917, who were treated as badly as slaves and the system was finally banned as it was no longer profitable.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_indenture_system

British or the West did NOT end slavery in India. In fact, British introduced slavery in India and then used Indian resources, and labor to work and fight in WW-2 on their behalf.

NNN - Debating about the Caste system or quoting anonymous dubious sources should be relegated to the comment section.
