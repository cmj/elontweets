NNN- the claim that 150 million chicken were slaughtered is 100% accurate. Instead of trying to get an ‚Äúown‚Äù, of which you didn‚Äôt, you instead, showed your dumbassery. Next time do it in the comments with a public profile, rather than anonymously with a note, coward.

NN, while CM is for factually incorrect information it is also used to add important context tomisleading posts. OP worded his statement to villianize the former president when it is actually a normal thing to cull herds when they test positive for highly infectious diseases.

Under the Animal Health Protection Act (7 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 8301-8322) the USDA‚Äôs Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) requires the culling of entire poultry flocks if one bird tests positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza. https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/hpai_response_plan.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com
