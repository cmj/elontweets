Stamping out has been a regularly practiced, internationally recognized best practice for dealing with bird flu. It was used under both the first Trump administration and will continue under the current administration according to Secretary Rollins.

NN, while CM is for factually incorrect information it is also used to add important context tomisleading posts. OP worded his statement to villianize the former president when it is actually a normal thing to cull herds when they test positive for highly infectious diseases.

Under the Animal Health Protection Act (7 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 8301-8322) the USDA‚Äôs Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) requires the culling of entire poultry flocks if one bird tests positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza. https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/hpai_response_plan.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com

NNN There‚Äôs no contention over the fact that ~150 million birds were culled, and it is a matter of opinion whether this is ‚Äúinsane‚Äù. Debate about USDA policy should be kept in the commentary, not community notes.

From March of 2023 to present, millions of birds have been culled. Biden was president. CN should use facts, not opinion, which are welcomed as commentary.

The OP is factually correct, the reasoning is irrelevant as it is correct regardless

NNN- the claim that 150 million chicken were slaughtered is 100% accurate. Instead of trying to get an ‚Äúown‚Äù, of which you didn‚Äôt, you instead, showed your dumbassery. Next time do it in the comments with a public profile, rather than anonymously with a note, coward.

A total of 954 cases of avian influenza‚Äîalso known as H5N1 and the bird flu‚Äîhave been reported globally since the World Health Organization (WHO) began tracking the infectious disease in 2003

Killing chickens by the millions is a bad policy and must be changed
