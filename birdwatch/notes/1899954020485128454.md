Biden did not purchase the car. Conversely, Trump purchased a Tesla, essentially using the White House as a salesroom.

NNN - (To respond to that one CN post) Trump has not officially purchased a Tesla as those cars we used as a stunt to show support for Elon and Tesla. Trump has not actually bought one.

This is nothing more than Elon expressing his agreement with the original post. If there are any disagreements with the original claim, it should be addressed there.

NNN

CN is incorrect in the definition of a salesroom. From Britannica Dictionary: 1, "a place where things that are for sale are displayed" 
https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/salesroom 

True in both cases

There is no difference between what Biden & Trump did. Both from the literal statement the CN made and logically.

Existing community note is retarded.  Author obviously doesn't understand what a "showroom" is.
