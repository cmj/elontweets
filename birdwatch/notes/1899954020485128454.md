Biden did not purchase the car. Conversely, Trump purchased a Tesla, essentially using the White House as a salesroom.

NNN

CN is incorrect in the definition of a salesroom. From Britannica Dictionary: 1, "a place where things that are for sale are displayed" 
https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/salesroom 

True in both cases

There is no difference between what Biden & Trump did. Both from the literal statement the CN made and logically.

Existing community note is retarded.  Author obviously doesn't understand what a "showroom" is.
