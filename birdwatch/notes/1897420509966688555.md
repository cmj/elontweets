NNN - keen passionfruit, the astronauts not being allowed to return for, "an undisclosed reason" would tend to confirm the posts claims that it was for political optics, but since "an undisclosed reason" is open ended, it fails to refute claims from those directly involved.

SpaceX actually sent a Dragon capsule to retrieve the two astronauts in September 2024 after dropping off two others under instruction from then-president Joe Biden, but SpaceX were forced to leave them stranded on the ISS for an undisclosed reason.

The "SpaceX could have sent up another Dragon" is accurate because they did actually send one on September 28 2024, which will be the astronaut's ride home. It is however potentially misleading because it may suggest this didn't happen. https://www.space.com/spacex-crew-9-astronaut-mission-iss-docking

a reminder to all: "I don't know" means no more or less than "I don't know"
Butch states *as fact* that they do not have the information on why they got stuck with a long-duration stay.
He states *as opinion* that he believes Musk.
reading more into that is misleading.
