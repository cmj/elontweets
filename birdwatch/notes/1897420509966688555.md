NNN - keen passionfruit, the astronauts not being allowed to return for, "an undisclosed reason" would tend to confirm the posts claims that it was for political optics, but since "an undisclosed reason" is open ended, it fails to refute claims from those directly involved.

SpaceX actually sent a Dragon capsule to retrieve the two astronauts in September 2024 after dropping off two others under instruction from then-president Joe Biden, but SpaceX were forced to leave them stranded on the ISS for an undisclosed reason.
