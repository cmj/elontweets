You people are obsessed with Elon Musk. Get a life. Let the man post an opinion without commenting FFS. CN is to correct misinformation not to comment on every post Elon makes.

Nothing wrong with Elon‚Äôs post expressing his  surprised reaction.
All proposed CN fits perfectly as commentaries for the OP. Reply directly to the post‚Äôs comments. NNN

NNN. Elon's father is a known liar and exaggerator. Elon's mother Maye Musk has stated on X that he was named after her grandfather John Elon Haldeman.

"How can this be real" doesn't need a CN

Almost every post of Elon's get a proposed CN

There's nothing misleading about Elon's question 

Answers to the question belong in replies

This is abuse of CN

The link in the CN does not support its claim regarding Elons father.

NNN. The proposed note is irrelevant. Elon's father, even if he had been aware of Von Braun's Mars statement, would have absolutely no way of knowing that his son would go on to create a space company that subsequently set its sights on Mars.

Musk‚Äôs father, Errol Musk, mentioned in 2022, that he took Elon‚Äôs name from the aforementioned book.

Von Braun was a Nazi rocket engineer, secretly moved by the US during Operation Paperclip. He developed the V-2 missile for Nazi Germany and the Saturn V for the US.

This isn‚Äôt the first time Elon has felt surreal about ‚ÄúElon‚Äù being the leader on Mars; the last time was in 2020.

In the manuscript, "Elon" is not a name but a job title, like e.g. "king" or "president". 
That means that anybody with whatever name could get elected the "Elon" of Mars for 5 years, according to that science fiction story.

Elon's father Errol built rockets as a youth. Family friend Herman  Oberth read Von Braun's technical books to Errol who liked the name Elon. Also, Maye Musk's grandfather's middle name was Elon.

Errol describes naming Elon after the Mars leader in this video.

Elon Musk‚Äôs father, Errol, said in 2022 he knew of von Braun‚Äôs Project Mars, where ‚ÄúElon‚Äù is a Martian leader. He chose the name partly for its biblical roots and its link to the book.
