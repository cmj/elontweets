NNN. The provided sources are directly from the government, which is inherently untrustworthy.

Examples of what is happening in South Africa against 'whites': https://www.news.com.au/world/africa/farmer-killings-farmers-tortured-and-killed-in-horrific-south-africa-raids/news-story/1aae3fe47328ada3b6a3d369675877df

The first note cites info from the 'source' (the Gov't) that is being accused of crimes against it's citizens - not reliable to trust the accused for unbiased info and is limited only to that.

Heroic Grassland Kingfisher - Stop abusing community notes. Not only is this personal opinion, you can't use the government website as a trustworthy source, especially when the accusations are against said government. Also, there's plenty of video footage of the slaughters.

The video peddles a lot of falsehoods. The South African government‚Äôs law on expropriation doesn‚Äôt do what the speaker claims it does. Also the SA government doesn‚Äôt murder farmers as claimed. The expropriation program is to correct apartheid era injustices.
