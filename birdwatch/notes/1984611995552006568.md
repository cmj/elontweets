Act 4 unfolded after Sam's tweet. He could not mention something that had not happened yet.

Also the email issue has been around for more than a year : https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/18d9y0g/cancelling_roadster_reservations/

It is important to mention that the Email delivery issue was existing for over a year and was only fixed after Sams tweet got attention. Without Sams tweet the email would still be not working.

Reddit is even less credible than Wikipedia. Do better.
