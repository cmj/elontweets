@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: The government in Britain is bribing hotel owners with multi-millions of pounds for SEVEN-year contracts to house illegal migrants. Their goal is obviously to amplify and extend the illegal migrant tidal wave, not reduce it. Anyone saying otherwise is a liar.

Paying a hotel to house migrants is not a bribe, its a business contract.

Elon Musk is deliberately twisting the story to fit his narrative about migrants in the UK .

Secro says they are not the only organization contracted to house asylee's.  Therefore giving a CN for Secro saying it wasn't them is not conclusive on whether the post is true.

Neither the post nor the article expressly says it was Serco who made the offer.  It generally speaks of Serco and organizations like it.  Serco’s own website says it has housed over 30,000 asylum seekers through 7,000 private landlord contracts.

NNN. This is the poster's opinion. Don't use community notes to disagree and push your opinion. Notes on original post also note that "Neither the post nor the article expressly says it was Serco who made the offer". Discuss further in comments if desired.
