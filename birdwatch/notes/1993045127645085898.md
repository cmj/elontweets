@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: America should not have worse voter ID requirements than every democratic country on Earth. California and New York actually banned use of ID to vote! It is illegal to show your ID in those states. The only reason to do this is fraud. | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1993045127645085898

“The only reason to oppose this is fraud” is incorrect. Voter ID disproportionately blocks poor, elderly, and transient voters, including out-of-state students.   It's a non-problem that even conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation acknowledge is exceedingly rare.

Australia is listed as requiring photo ID. In my 18 years voting, I’ve never had to show ID. https://www.voteaustralia.org.au/identifying_voters

California does not ban the use of ID to vote, it bans its counties from mandating ID to vote. In some cases, ID is still required, such as in the case of mail-in voting.

Notes miss key points or irrelevant, and have argumentative or biased language. A note is not needed as this expresses a personal opinion. In particular the Voter ID laws in California and NY are a correct assessment.
