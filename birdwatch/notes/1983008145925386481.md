Open-source software requires the source code to be released under an open-source license that allows modification and redistribution.
As of now, only parts of xAI’s work are available, while Grokipedia’s full codebase, editorial system, and datasets have not been released.

Grokipedia is not an open-source project. Its GitHub repository at https://github.com/Grokipedia/.github includes only a README.md file and lacks any actual source code.

As per the Open Source Initiative’s definition, software must publicly provide its source code to qualify as open source.

To the NNNs pointing to the github page: did a single one of you actually even click that link?  There is no code whatsoever on the git repo, just a single .md file for the landing page. That is not open source, it is entirely closed and opaque.

It means articles on Grokipedia are in the public domain and can be used free of charge- Sometimes referred to as “open source“. While “open source“ is often used for software, it is not limited to such and can apply to literature in general.

It is brand new. Give them time to make sure they have things the way they want it. 

There is a clear history of providing open source from X/xAI. They are saying they plan to do the same here. The CNs started on this at less than 12 hours from the release of Grokipedia.

The link cited clearly expressed that is not the official repository.

"This was an unofficial project pitching a Wikipedia alternate powered by Grok to XAI. Due to XAI creating its own project of the same name, we are shutting down development (never really got that far tbh)"

He is expressing that the knowledge is open sourced for to all to use, not that the code is open source software. Open source is not strictly limited to just providing software source code
