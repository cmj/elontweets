As the Community Note states, all employees were offered 8 months of pay & benefits. https://t.co/8djYsnWTJG | ‚Ü≥ 11,626 ‚áÖ 30,368 ‚ô• 176,981 ü°ï 12,765,075 | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1891316488268824621

I don't understand those who say 60 mins aren't lying, just quoting what Kristina Drye said. So, if you find a liar and quote their lie, then it is not a lie? What kind of logic is this? The guy who fired them makes a statement that all fired employees are getting paid 8 months.

NNN Elon Musk's statement is accurate. 8 months severance pay with benefits was offered to all 3 million federal employees. Current proposed CN's belong in the comments section.

The note from Scholarly Grass Friarbird is misleading and not needed.
The voiceover in the 60 Minutes solemnly  intones "All gone overnight."
60 minutes clearly accepts and affirms Drye's statement.

Per the included screenshot, it is the quoted former USAID beneficiary, Kristina Drye, who made the claim seemingly being responded to and described as a lie, not 60 Minutes.

'60Minutes' aren't lying since they are only quoting Kristina Drye, who lost their job.

As of the time Elon made this post, this is only a Proposed Community Note. It has not yet been rated "Helpful" nor "Not Helpful" and may contain incorrect information.
