The note from Scholarly Grass Friarbird is misleading and not needed.
The voiceover in the 60 Minutes solemnly  intones "All gone overnight."
60 minutes clearly accepts and affirms Drye's statement.

Per the included screenshot, it is the quoted former USAID beneficiary, Kristina Drye, who made the claim seemingly being responded to and described as a lie, not 60 Minutes.
