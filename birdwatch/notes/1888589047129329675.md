Bubbly Cove Sandpiper Correctly points out that impeachment is the correct way to remove Federal judges but that information should be in the comments. There are no factual errors in the OP. https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S4-1/ALDE_00000282/#:~:text=Article%20II%2C%20Section%204%3A,other%20high%20Crimes%20and%20Misdemeanors.

In every state, judges are already elected, with some differences in different states.  You can already vote for them to be removed by simply... voting against them.
