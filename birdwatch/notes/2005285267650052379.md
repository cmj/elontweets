Claims that Ireland is "banning" anonymous accounts to "imprison" dissenters are unfounded. The 2026 "digital wallet" pilot is for age verification to protect minors, not a general ban on anonymity. No law exists to imprison or bankrupt users for anonymous social media use.

Note not needed.

The Tánaiste Simon Harris (second highest ranking politician in the country) has clearly said the government wants to ban anonymous accounts.
