Elon Musk's X is facing a 120 million Euro fine over deceptive business practices and lack of transparency:

Citizens of EU countries overwhelmingly support their country's EU membership, so membership DOES represent the will of their people:

Important context: Musk's latest attacks on the EU follow a €120 million fine issued to X due to deceptive design of its ‘blue checkmark', the lack of transparency of its advertising repository, and the failure to provide access to public data for researchers.

The EU is a supranational union of sovereign states with legal withdrawal (Article 50 TEU), while the US is an indissoluble federation where unilateral secession is unconstitutional (Texas v. White, 1869).

In short… The USA can’t be dissolved while the EU can.
