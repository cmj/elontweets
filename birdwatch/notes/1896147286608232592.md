Elon does not say that spending for Ukraine/Zelensky approval dropped because of the White House meeting. Just that it is down.  Until a new poll comes out his statement is correct.

Note needed. "Just a fact" is the opposite of an opinion. The post is misleading, because the poll is older than the recent events,so it does not show the effect of what happened.
