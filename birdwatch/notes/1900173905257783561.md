This comment’s deeply concerning for American democracy.

American judges are the bedrock of USA constitution. This is stronger than gun rights

All examples of governments interfering with these rights reflect dictatorship or worse, Hitler being an extreme example

This is his opinion. Of consideration, needs to be that this is an important man in US politics who is not elected. His opinions has power. His opinion may well be misconstrued as fact by a broader audience. This is the danger of him expressing his opinion as if it was a fact.

NNN
This is an opinion and is allowed

If a CN is warranted it should be on the original post not on a post just because Elon Musk agreed 

CN comments belong as a reply

Elon's post is a personal opinion

NNN. I disagree with this statement as much as you. But it is an opinion so the correct course of action is to respond in the comments. You can’t use notes for increased clout.
