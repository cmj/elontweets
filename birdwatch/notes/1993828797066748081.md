Neither being fascist nor a Nazi requires someone to be physically violent.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism

Describing someone as fascist or a Nazi based on their words or actions is not an incitement to violence and is protected free speech in the US.

Musk says calling someone a Nazi is “incitement to murder”. Cruz still calls Fuentes a Nazi, despite warning that such labels justify violence. He says it fits Fuentes’ beliefs, but Fuentes never called himself a Nazi. By Musk’s rule, Cruz is using a double standard

NNN. CN is both missing the point, and arguing on  technicalities. Musk using the word "should" clearly shows he is stating an opinion.

NNN Elon Musk is expressing a personal opinion.  All counter opinions belong in the comments.  Also, references to Ted Cruz's statements are irrelevant to an opinion posted by Musk.  Again, take it to the comments.

This is Elon Musk’s post, not Ted Cruz’s. You’re welcome to call Ted Cruz a hypocrite in the comments.

Elon condemns labeling non-violent people as "Nazis" or "fascists" as incitement to murder—to avoid demonizing innocents amid rising violence like the Kirk assassination & National Guard shootings; Cruz's description of Fuentes as a "Nazi" for declaring himself on "Team Hitler.”
