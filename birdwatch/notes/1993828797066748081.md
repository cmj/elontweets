Musk says calling someone a Nazi is “incitement to murder”. Cruz still calls Fuentes a Nazi, despite warning that such labels justify violence. He says it fits Fuentes’ beliefs, but Fuentes never called himself a Nazi. By Musk’s rule, Cruz is using a double standard

Elon condemns labeling non-violent people as "Nazis" or "fascists" as incitement to murder—to avoid demonizing innocents amid rising violence like the Kirk assassination & National Guard shootings; Cruz's description of Fuentes as a "Nazi" for declaring himself on "Team Hitler.”

This is Elon Musk’s post, not Ted Cruz’s. You’re welcome to call Ted Cruz a hypocrite in the comments.
