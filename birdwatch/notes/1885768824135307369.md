And they will make it sound like we’re cutting funding to save baby pandas when we’re actually cutting funding to fraudsters, wastrels & terrorists 🤣🤣 This is only possible because of President @realDonaldTrump.

Elon Musk has received, and continues to receive, government funding.  A recipient of government funds should not be entrusted with oversight of government expenditures due to conflict of interest.
