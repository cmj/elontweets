NNN: There is no evidence of any interruption in disabled veterans services. The departments that have been audited thus far have been excessively spending Tax Payers money and in some cases committing Fraud. 

A common claim is that a essential service is shut down. That's a lie

A meme posted with a puffed quip followed by a laughing emoji is clearly not intended to be taken literally. As already stated, it's puffery. Puffery is generally defined as subjective, often boastful statements that most people wouldn't take literally, like ‚Äúworld's best pizza.‚Äù

The context of the post is a meme. There's no indication that Musk is making a factual claim. Rather, it falls under the legal concept of puffery.

Meme's are just one tool in many that are used to express opinion.
One can't simply claim that because something is a 'meme' that it is beyond dispute.

All communication is meant to sway opinion.

Polls do not show 90% of Americans supporting DOGE. YouGov reports DOGE is viewed favorably by 42% of people, with the lowest net favorability of the 15 agencies in the poll.
