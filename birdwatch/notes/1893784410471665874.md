[Sun Feb 23, 2025 22:06:02 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)„Äêùóï„Äë: Wow [@MilaLovesJoe] This is how OUT OF CONTROL California is. 449,000 REGISTERED VOTERS couldn't perform jury duty because they weren't citizens. But they are REGISTERED VOTERS! A half a million of them.  ABSOLUTELY NO federal aid without Voter ID.  https://t.co/tAozXnBDsk | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1893784410471665874

NNN: Put the note on the original post that is causing harm. 
PS. I find it disturbing that Elon himself likely has access to CNs, but blatantly ignores the proposed fact checks. He‚Äôs quite frequently noted and wears it as a medal?

Musk is responding to a post repeating lies from 2019 that were debunked at the time. The CA juror pool is not limited to registered voters; it includes anyone with a driver‚Äôs license or state ID, which legal non-citizens obtain.
