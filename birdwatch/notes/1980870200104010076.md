The graph shows number of arrests: many arrests do not lead to convictions.

“repeat offenders” is not the same as “people with multiple arrests”.

Discussions of the graph should be on the post of the graph, not on those who quite it. Stop the abuse. 

Nothing on in the proposed CN talks about Musk post. Rather it  addressed the quoted post. The goal of CNs is not to 'get one up on Musk or any other individual'.
