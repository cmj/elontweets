@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: We will use Grok 3.5 (maybe we should call it 4), which has advanced reasoning, to rewrite the entire corpus of human knowledge, adding missing information and deleting errors.

Rewriting the entire corpus of human knowledge will inherently have extreme bias if it is done by a small group working at xAI, influenced by the world view of its founder Elon Musk.

Esa es la opinión personal de Elon. La respuesta debe ser en los comentarios, no mediante nota de la comunidad.
