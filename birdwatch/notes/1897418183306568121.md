[Wed Mar 05, 2025 22:45:21 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: 🤨 [@libsoftiktok] CNN just quietly edited their "fact check" article after they reported that Trump's statement on spending $8 million for making mice transgender was "false." It sounds so crazy that they thought Trump made it up… It’s 100% true and now even CNN is forced to admit it https://t.co/oVETMXbKQG | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1897418183306568121

It said transGENIC mice, not transgender. The study was to study the effects of certain viruses on the human body.
