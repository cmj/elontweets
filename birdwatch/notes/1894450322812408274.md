[Tue Feb 25, 2025 18:12:08 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)„Äêùóï„Äë: I wonder how long this has been going on.  These are individuals with the ability to spy on any Americans at will. [@realchrisrufo] EXCLUSIVE: NSA, DIA, and Navy intel officials blast @libsoftiktok as a "fucking monster" and argue that @benshapiro should be "expelled from the tribe" for "constantly spout[ing] hate speech." They also slur Italian-Americans as "terrible people." This is getting personal. https://t.co/dV9yJWErOa | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1894450322812408274

The US cannot ‚Äúspy on any Americans at will‚Äù 

The Protect America Act provides to Americans in the United States ‚Äì electronic surveillance targeting a person in the U.S. required a court order before the Protect America Act, and that requirement remains in place today.  US DOJ
