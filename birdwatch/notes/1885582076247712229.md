[Sat Feb 01, 2025 06:52:54 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: The @DOGE team discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups.  They literally never denied a payment in their entire career.  Not even once. [@robbystarbuck] The highest ranking Treasury official, David A Lebryk, is resigning rather than complying with a request by @DOGE for access to audit where they’ve spent trillions of dollars a year. Why would career bureaucrats fear an audit by @elonmusk and @doge to see where we can save money? https://t.co/lccLXJOL6M | ↳ 20,124 ⇅ 87,957 ♥ 330,036 🡕 29,824,827 | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1885582076247712229

No note needed.  Bro wouldn't have resigned if he was straight up and had nothing to hide/fear

It’s always disappointing to see CN just post links from the organisation that is being investigated. The fact it has been investigated and found to have breached the rules they advertise is the actual point of an investigation so to just cut and paste links is a waste of time.

NNN - If they have such higher control over operations, why not accept an audit over it? 
Anyways, the post does not say anything about current protocols, just the fact that the current chief is freaking out about a simple audit.

Although Congress is responsible for allocating funds, government agencies still have a responsibility to ensure funds are allocated correctly.  https://www.gao.gov/blog/2016/11/01/following-the-money-the-audit-trail

Congress decides where money is spent. The department in Treasury that is referred to in this tweet cuts the checks, they don't get to decide whether or not the money is spent.
