[Mon Feb 10, 2025 19:55:53 UTC] @elonmusk (Harry Bōlz)【𝗕】: Under Biden, FEMA took money AWAY from Americans in need of disaster relief and spent it on 5 star hotels for illegals.  Pure evil. [@nicksortor] They told us FEMA had NO money for Americans on Maui NO money for Americans in East Palestine, Ohio NO money for Americans in Western North Carolina BUT FEMA HAD AN EXTRA $1 BILLION TO SPEND ON ILLEGALS??  WTF? This is CRIMINAL! https://t.co/ovTxrgz7Bh | ↳ 11,792 ⇅ 70,768 ♥ 277,017 🡕 16,036,968 | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1889040611480584602

The SSP, as directed by Congress, is administered by FEMA in partnership with US Customs and Border Protection to provide sheltering and related activities to noncitizen migrants following their release from the DHS. This is separate and distinct from disaster relief funds. https://www.fema.gov/grants/shelter-services-program
