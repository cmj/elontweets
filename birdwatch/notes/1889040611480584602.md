The SSP, as directed by Congress, is administered by FEMA in partnership with US Customs and Border Protection to provide sheltering and related activities to noncitizen migrants following their release from the DHS. This is separate and distinct from disaster relief funds. https://www.fema.gov/grants/shelter-services-program
