[Thu Feb 13, 2025 15:26:07 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)„Äêùóï„Äë: Reuters received far more money than this from US government organizations, but via various subsidiaries and intermediaries to hide how they were getting it.  This is just what @DOGE has found so far. https://t.co/PXbL1OkEKO | ‚Ü≥ 7,926 ‚áÖ 53,145 ‚ô• 228,019 ü°ï 19,593,080 | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1890059886270255195

NNN - not misleading
- "Under Trump" ‚â† "By Trump"
- Image reads as "to study [LSD]" without making the claim it was necessarily LSD itself
- Reuters was paid which is true regardless to which division within
- "Publicly available" is not the same as the public being aware

This statement is misleading:

* The contract was first awarded under Trump in 2018
* Paid to Reuters' data division, not the newsroom
* For researching *defenses* against deception
* Not revealed by "DOGE investigations"; was a public record, visible online for many years
