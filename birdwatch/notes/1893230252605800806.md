NNN - Elon Musk is factually correct.  Illegals were given hotel rooms and FEMA didn’t have enough money to respond to disaster.  Correct his vernacular in the comments.

FEMA disaster relief funds—intended for victims of all disasters, not just hurricanes in red states—are separate and distinct from the Shelter Services Program, which provides shelter and related assistance to migrants following their release from DHS. No funds were “stolen.”

These funds weren’t stolen. The money was separately allocated to pay for immigrant services. 

"The streams of funding are different, that is not an untrue statement, of course," Johnson, R-La., told Fox News’ Shannon Bream on "Fox News Sunday."
