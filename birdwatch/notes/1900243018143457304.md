Starlink can only service a limited number of connections in an area. Brisbane & Perth are already at capacity https://www.starlink.com/au/map

Starlink is not viable replacement for wired connections in urban areas. It is a viable alternative in regional areas serviced by NBN satellite or fixed wireless.

The limit of the FTTP is right now 1Gbit due to it being GPON, because that's whats offered,  but the service is future safe and is easily and upgraded to 10Gbit and beyond. Important context.

This is upgrade to fibre to the premise – as opposed to fibre to a node in the street and copper for the final stretch – at an average cost to NBN Co of about $6000 each. Full fibre access can now support 1Gbps compared to starlink 250Mbps.

The NBN upgrade is to go to Fibre to the Premises (FTTP).

FTTP has a maximum throughput of 1Gb/s

Starlink has attained max speeds of 470Mb/s in Australia.

It’s possible this claim of 4x faster speed is when compared to NBN Sky Muster, which is a different product

This is a personal opinion.  NNN - would be a great addition in the comment section.

Regardless of the technology being used its still over $6000 per home. This is way to high.
