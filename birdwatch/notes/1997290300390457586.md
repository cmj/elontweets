SA laws do not say the government must discriminate against non-Black citizens. B-BEE and Employment Equity are affirmative-action measures to address apartheid, not racial exclusion. Starlink was refused because it lacks required ICASA licensing, not due to race.

It is true Starlink  is effectively banned in SA

The SA government effectively bans white people due to their ‘diversity inclusion and quota rules relating to black peoples employment 

Some of the poorest are actually White in South Africa

The claim is correct, if Elon musk was black, starlink would automatically meet the ICASA criteria. The only reason it does not automatically qualify is because he is white, requiring him to sell 30% shares to any black person - then starlink qualifies. Race is the only reason.

NNN, ‪I-ECNS/I-ECS licenses require 30% ownership by historically disadvantaged groups (mostly Black South Africans). For Starlink to qualify, Elon has to sell 30% of local entity’s shares to specifically Black South African investors to qualify for the licenses. It is racist.‬

NNN - the community note tries to push an SA government disinformation campaign which has been debunked and discredited.

Facts are that there are 140+ racist laws in SA discriminating based on race, used to marginalise minorities. Elon's post is 100% factually correct.

NNN. They lack licensing specifically due to racial composition. This is also his opinion. On no grounds is a CN appropriate here.
