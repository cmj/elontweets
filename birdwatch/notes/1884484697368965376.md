The 5 million figure includes both formal removals and self-deportations, both of which involve individuals leaving the U.S. under immigration enforcement policies. Further distinctions between types of deportation are better suited for the comments section. https://www.factcheck.org/2015/12/ted-cruz-on-deportations/?utm_source=chatgpt.com

NNN
Proposed CN's regarding "deportations" and "returns" whose sum is about the same as OP's numbers are attempting to make a "distinction without a difference". Those should be comments, not CN's.

NNN — A voluntary deportation is a deportation. It's likely that many deportations under the Trump admin will be also voluntary for those who'd like to avoid future consequences of a formal deportation (e.g. reentering after deportation is a felony). Stop abusing community notes.

President Clinton's administration had so many deportations because of a 1996 law that retroactively allowed deportation for minor crimes committed even decades earlier. https://truthout.org/articles/the-uss-immigration-crackdown-began-decades-ago-under-clinton/

Bill Clinton forcibly deported 870,000 illegal immigrants.
Another 11.4 Million were apprehended, deemed deportable, yet given the option to leave voluntarily under supervision in lieu of going through formal removal proceedings which would have gone on their record.

The claim that Bill Clinton deported 12M people is misleading. Only ~870K were formally deported; the rest left voluntarily after being apprehended. The number includes returns, not just removals, making it inaccurate to compare with later deportation figures.
