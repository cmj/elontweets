While being a conservative at Harvard is uncommon, it is NOT illegal, by any stretch of the imagination.  It also affected by conservatives opting for careers other than academia.

Elite U.S. universities do not have jurisdiction to make legal judgements on political parties. However, the Smith Act (18 U.S.C. § 2385) is still law, which prohibits participation in activities advocating the violent overthrow of the federal government.

Natural Lagoon Scaup: This is the worst proposed CN I have ever seen. All that you did was repost a Grok response that does not refute the post or quote. Don’t bother with CN proposals if you are not mentally capable of handling information that challenges your worldview.

NNN. Elon is clearly being satirical / joking based on the numbers displayed in the chart. 

If you want to factually contest the data, do so on the original post being quoted.
