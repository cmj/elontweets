[Mon Feb 10, 2025 10:03:25 UTC] @elonmusk (Harry B≈çlz)„Äêùóï„Äë: The @DOGE team just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants.  Sending this money violated the law and is in gross insubordination to the President‚Äôs executive order.  That money is meant for American disaster relief‚Ä¶ | ‚Ü≥ 38,683 ‚áÖ 113,610 ‚ô• 609,067 ü°ï 58,822,821 | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1888891512303263815

@FEMA_Cam, Cameron Hamilton,  confirmed this is true, thanked @DOGE, and posted the payments were stopped;

NNN. This post speaks about $59m sent last week (Feb 2024) and presidential executive orders made prior to this. The suggested note from Artistic Pine Toucan quotes a Reuters source article from October 2024. This is irrelevant to the original post and potentially misleading.

Elon is right.  Here is the United State Code.

NNN. Poster is claiming that sending FEMA money to the hotels is a violation of the President's executive orders. 

It does not matter what it was for or what contracts are there, the order cancelled those contracts so the payments are illegal.

Note needed. A high-raking FEMA official has confirmed that FEMA was twice authorized by Congress to make the payments.

DOGE has requested FEMA to halt the payments, and they complied, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that the payments were fully authorized and legal.

Important context: FEMA has a specific funding stream, appropriated by Congress, for emergency non-citizen shelter. 

This funding is distinct from disaster relief. Impoundment of funds voted by Congress is not a power the President possesses, since 1974.

The claim that FEMA sent $59M last week to luxury hotels in NYC for migrants is false. FEMA‚Äôs Shelter and Services Program (SSP) is separate from disaster relief and follows congressional allocations. No laws or executive orders were violated.

Elon tries to frame existing contracts are fraudulent.
He needs to stop spreading disinformation.
