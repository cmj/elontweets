NNN. A man is entitled to his opinion 
(which is: the Judiciary has no authority to stop the Executive branch from executive oversight)

NNN, this post is not misleading, it shares an opinion. Community notes is not the place for your irrelevant, rife-with-grammatical-errors summary of the separation of powers. Leave it in the comments.

The Untied States was founded with checks and balances. The founding fathers made it a priority to set up a system where no branch had higher authority than the other. Federal Judges are requested by the President and approved by Congress. 

Please, read the constitution.

The purpose of the judicial branch is to check power as part of the checks and balances system our forefathers created.

Congress, the legislative, and the Judiciary each have equal power to the whole executive.

The U.S. is a constitutional republic, where the chief executive and representatives are elected and the rules are recorded in a constitution.

The U.S. Constitution grants judicial power to the Courts, that extends to all cases in law and equity under this Constitution.
