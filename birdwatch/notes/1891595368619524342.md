NNN - Opinionated note; nothing from Elon's response indicates he will take custody of other countries' assets.

I agree on the first portion of the CN; that might be interesting context. However, the 2nd half makes an assumption without reliable sourcing.

That's not entirely true
Many countries have their reserves stored in other countries, being the USA one of the recipients of that gold.
Elon Musk remark suggests that US are considering a take over on the gold reserves of their allies
