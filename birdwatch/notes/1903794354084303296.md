While Grok can edit images, this was not edited by Grok. This was edited by the communist leader Joseph Stalin during “The Great Purge”, where Nikolai Yezhov (right) was removed by Joseph Stalin (middle). Without the context users may be mislead and not understand the joke.

Grok can only edit images it generated in previous conversation turns. It cannot edit photos or images uploaded by users or from other sources.

This photograph showing Nikolai Yezhov being removed after he was purged.  
 He was a Soviet secret police official under Joseph Stalin who was head of the NKVD from 1936 to 1938, during the height of the Great Purge. He fell from Stalin' favour and executed in 1940.

NNN.  This is a famous photo that Stalin edited to present a fake version of history to Soviet people.  People who understand a little bit of history should recognize the historic reference to Stalin’s authoritarianism and understand this is satire.

NNN The community notes stating that GROK can not remove images is incorrect.

The context added by others is useful in that Stalin actually had the original photo edited to remove the man on the right. However, the edited image shown does not match Stalin's edit, as can be seen by comparing the top of the wall. It is flat in Stalin's edit.

This photo is a famous example of how images were edited, using analog techniques. The joke is that now it's much easier with Grok.
