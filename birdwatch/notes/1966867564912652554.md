While "national socialists" is literally in the name, the nazis  adopted mainly extreme, far right-wing ideas, but did include some left-wing socialist ideas (for the "correct" people), too, like centralized state control over some industries).

The Nazis were not socialists. They outlawed socialist parties, they burned books by socialist thinkers, and sent socialists to concentration camps.
