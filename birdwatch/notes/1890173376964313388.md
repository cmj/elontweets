NNN- while Marbury and Madison created Judicial review, Mississippi v Johnson 71 US 475, 1867 states that the President cannot be restrained by injunction from carrying into effect a congressional law, this can be interpreted also as engaging in executive functions like audits https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/71/475/

NNN. You are not lawyers. This has nothing to do with judicial review. It is an opinion about the scope of such review by district courts. The concept of a nationwide injunction has been called into doubt by a sitting SCOTUS Justice and academics:

Marbury v. Madison (1803) established the principle of judicial review, meaning that the Supreme Court has the authority to review laws and executive actions to determine if they are constitutional. However, it does not grant any judge in the US this power.

The Constitution grants courts the power to block unlawful executive actions (Marbury v. Madison, Article III). Since 1803 the courts have checked presidential overreach to uphold democracy. Without judicial review we wouldn‚Äôt have democracy we‚Äôd have dictatorship.

These three branches ‚Äî legislative, executive, and judicial ‚Äî operate within a constitutional system of ‚Äúchecks and balances.‚Äù This means that although each branch is formally separate from the other two, the Constitution often requires cooperation among the branches. https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/court-role-and-structure#:~:text=The%20judicial%20branch%2C%20in%20turn,branch%20to%20enforce%20court%20decisions.
