NNN The post is an opinion. The words, “every”, “everywhere”, “any”, and “anywhere “ preclude the need for a note.

There are 4 conditions ALL of which must be true for the conclusion to be valid. The key point is “EVERY action” being a condition. If any judge can stop the subset of actions that are illegal… that’s democracy, but if they can stop EVERY (including legal) action, that’s not

NNN- while Marbury and Madison created Judicial review, Mississippi v Johnson 71 US 475, 1867 states that the President cannot be restrained by injunction from carrying into effect a congressional law, this can be interpreted also as engaging in executive functions like audits https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/71/475/

NNN. You are not lawyers. This has nothing to do with judicial review. It is an opinion about the scope of such review by district courts. The concept of a nationwide injunction has been called into doubt by a sitting SCOTUS Justice and academics:

Marbury v. Madison (1803) established the principle of judicial review, meaning that the Supreme Court has the authority to review laws and executive actions to determine if they are constitutional. However, it does not grant any judge in the US this power.

Judges must justify their rulings through constitutional standards and legal precedent, and higher courts can reverse any judgment that exceeds these limits. This ensures valid presidential actions remain intact while blocking only those found unconstitutional.

The United States IS NOT A DEMOCRACY but a constitutional republic with democratic principles. In a pure democracy, citizens directly vote on laws and policies. No elected representatives (like presidents) make decisions on the people's behalf.https://www.britannica.com/topic/direct-democracy

NN— Elon isn’t stating an opinion, he’s making a statement. A statement that completely ignores the concept of “Checks and Balances” within the Government. This is why we have 3 different branches of Government— The Executive, Legislative, and Judicial.

Note is to clarify.

The Constitution grants courts the power to block unlawful executive actions (Marbury v. Madison, Article III). Since 1803 the courts have checked presidential overreach to uphold democracy. Without judicial review we wouldn’t have democracy we’d have dictatorship.

These three branches — legislative, executive, and judicial — operate within a constitutional system of “checks and balances.” This means that although each branch is formally separate from the other two, the Constitution often requires cooperation among the branches. https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/court-role-and-structure#:~:text=The%20judicial%20branch%2C%20in%20turn,branch%20to%20enforce%20court%20decisions.
