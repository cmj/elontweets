The Constitution grants courts the power to block unlawful executive actions (Marbury v. Madison, Article III). Since 1803 the courts have checked presidential overreach to uphold democracy. Without judicial review we wouldn‚Äôt have democracy we‚Äôd have dictatorship.

These three branches ‚Äî legislative, executive, and judicial ‚Äî operate within a constitutional system of ‚Äúchecks and balances.‚Äù This means that although each branch is formally separate from the other two, the Constitution often requires cooperation among the branches. https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/court-role-and-structure#:~:text=The%20judicial%20branch%2C%20in%20turn,branch%20to%20enforce%20court%20decisions.
