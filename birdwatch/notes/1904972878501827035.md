This post is clearly satirical or meant as a provocation. Without the video, we can't determine whether it's a Nazi salute or not. An image can be interpreted in many different ways and it's probably another provocation by Elon like before :

NNN - This post is clearly satirical and juxtaposes against accusations of Elon Musk performing a Nazi salute at a Trump rally during the 2024 presidential election. https://x.com/kyg_best/status/1881457882316824682?s=46
