The quoted screenshot is not congruent wuth many other attempts to recreate using grok. Most attempts resemble other chat model responses that he is trying to contact with this quote.

The post that Musk quoted is only one reply to the original tweet. Many other replies show Grok calling white pride "supremacist" while calling black pride "resilience" or "empowering", meaning its responses are inconsistent.
