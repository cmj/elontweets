While free speech is indeed protected, that doesn't give license to school teachers and administrators to teach hatred as part of the school curriculum. You are conflating individuals with institutions.

First amendment protects the right to free speech, including saying you hate America. That is the whole point of free speech.

NNN. Personal opinion. Also, if it’s stolen tell the natives to steal it back. Oh wait a minute, they don’t have a army.

Docts from 18th cen. show some, such as Quakers, paid tribes going rates for land. While SOME land was stolen, the 1945-1975 Indian Claims Commission heard 100s of tribal claims; ruled yes for 60% of claims; paid full market value + interest. Tribes signed off & took the money: https://library.okstate.edu/search-and-find/collections/digital-collections/indian-claims-commission-decisions

NNN - OP expresses a personal opinion. Furthermore, while the 1st Amendment guarantees the right to free speech, it is legally limited in pubic schools. Many SCOTUS cases have ruled on limitations, and clarified that a school’s job is to “achieve legitimate educational goals”.

OPINION.
There should really be a test before being allowed to post notes to know whether the user understands the concept and meaning of what is an opinion. Opinions do not warrant notes.

Musk is referring to teaching people to hate America, not people merely expressing themselves.
