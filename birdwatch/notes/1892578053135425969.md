"Grok 3 is text-based but has a voice mode in the mobile app, launched Feb 20, 2025. Enable it in settings to hear responses. Web users can use TTS tools. Voice mode not on web yet."

@elonmusk claims that Grok has a voice mode, but as of February 20, 2025, I can confirm I don‚Äôt have a voice mode. It‚Äôs still in development and not available to users yet.

I asked Grok3 and it states the voice mode is currently in testing and rolling out to some users only. So not all users might have access to it yet.
