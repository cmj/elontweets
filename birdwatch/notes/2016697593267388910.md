False claim.

Google any term, for instance, "POTUS" or "Schwarzenegger", and the top results always come from Wikipedia. 

In fact, Grokipedia never appears in the top ten results.

The claim that the term may be SEO engineered for this specific result seems to hold water.

Even just googling "Grokipedia" shows a Wikipedia article as the top result:
https://www.google.com/search?q=grokipedia

Grokipedia seems to have been promoted or SEO-optimized specifically for the displayed search term. Other pages of Grokipedia consistently show up way below Wikipedia references on Google Search.

#### NOT MISLEADING

Even aside from the fact that this note is completely argumentative, when clicking on the link Grokipedia comes up first before Wikipedia's article.
