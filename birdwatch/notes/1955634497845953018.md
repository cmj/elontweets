Although it says it was from 50 years ago, the “doge” meme wasn’t created back then. The photo of doge was taken in 2010, and not in 1975, as the user says.

NNN- This is clearly stated as an AI rendering of a childhood photo of the original post author. It is easily understood that the photo is old, but the Grok video rendering is new. Nitpicking the details should be reserved for comments.

NNN- It's a dog, which did infact exist 50 years ago.
