@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: Because they will not go against their voting constituency. Almost all criminals vote Democrat, because it is the soft-on-crime party. This is just a fact. That’s why Democrat activists always solicit votes from jails. | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/2009296606726680680

The Marshal Project survey acknowledges that the results aren't representative of the whole prison population as whites were over represented in the sample.

This is not a fact, it is an unproven probably overstatement of an assumption. It is not up to community note writers to factcheck.

Recent data contradicts Elon’s claim, as a 2024 Marshall Project poll of over 54,000 U.S. inmates found strong support for Donald Trump, with many favoring Republican tough-on-crime policies over Democratic reform agendas.

The above note is wrong. 54000 people were the amount of respondents to the survey, not the amount of Trump supporters. 
The article says "roughly half" of respondents would vote for Trump. It doesn't specify how many. It can well be 45%, making Elon correct.
