Elon Musk being in control of USAID should be able to provide sources & evidences of his allegations. Being in control of USAID, this cannot be the expression of an opinion, and therefore needs sources.
Unfortunately, he shut down USAID website, preventing us from checking.

There‚Äôs no evidence USAID is pushing censorship laws in Europe. The EU‚Äôs digital regulations, like the DSA, are independent policies. USAID focuses on media freedom, not censorship.
