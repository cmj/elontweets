The "$7,800 per week for protesting" is a misinterpretation of a U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights (USCPR) 7 month fellowship program.
The fellowship program was for 7 months at 8 hours per week for up to $7,840 in total, not per week. USCPR has no links to Tesla protests

Elon protestors being paid $7,800 per week is a misinterpretation of a NY Post article from April 2024 on a Palestinian rights group fellowship program. The program was actually for 7 months of work at 8 hours per week for up to $7,840. This is unrelated to Elon Musk.
