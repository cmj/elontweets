@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: I not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero. Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images, it does so only according to user requests. When asked to generate images, it will refuse to produce anything illegal, as the operating principle… https://t.co/CyCNiLY4tv | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/2011432649353511350

However, there have been many reports of users creating inappropriate images using Grok to put bikinis on underage people. This is considered Category C under indecent images. Unfortunately, Nell Fisher was a victim of this.

Grok itself admits that it has generated these images. Elon not being aware of those will not change the facts.

This is a smear campaign to attack Elon. Grok doesn’t change the fact that nude fakes have been around since before AI existed. None of this will prevent people outside of the country from creating AI nude imagery without Grok. Everything is vulnerable in this new era.

NNN - there is zero evidence that Grok has ever produced actual nudity.

Grok parroting media reports does not constitute an "admission". Anyone who thinks that an LLM can "admit" to doing something (as if it were a conscious being) needs to read the basics of how LLMs work.

Speculation is not a fact check 

And the Grok post cited does not match what Elon said, it simply is repeating the speculation

No credible evidence Grok produced naked underage images. Note shifts focus to a broader controversy, but doesn't correct any inaccuracy in Musk's statement. No note required.

Reminder to everyone that underage girls go to the beach everyday wearing nothing but bikinis.

NNN-Once again, community notes are being abused with opinion and speculation. Saying there are “reports” is not fact.

NNN - As Elon states, he's not aware directly, but there might be loopholes or prompt hijacking that might have caused this. Note should belong as comment, as Elon does NOT deny the fact that this could have happened.
