The decline’s pace (0.45% yearly) is slow enough that no emergency looms by 2025, but fast enough that in 25-50 years, the numbers could feel critical if no adjustments are made. Measures aren’t urgent like a wildfire, but proactive steps could shape the outcome.

Misleading:
White people aren't going extinct. The population of white people worldwide has decreased, but only due to low birth rates and faster growth elsewhere. No extinction will occur, and this pattern of gradual loss could end with higher birth rates in the white pop.

No, whites aren't facing extinction. Global share dropped from ~30% (1900) to ~10% (2025) due to low birth rates & faster growth elsewhere. Still ~800M people; projections show hundreds of millions through 2100. Demographic shift, not disappearance. (238 chars)

Speculation about the future cannot be fact-checked. Long-term global demographic trends lend credence to Musk's gloomy forecast.

NNN, post is a valid notion and all current notes are speculation.
