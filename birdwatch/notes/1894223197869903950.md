[Tue Feb 25, 2025 03:09:37 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)„Äêùóï„Äë: It‚Äôs not just that borders were ‚Äúleft open‚Äù.  There was a massive, concerted campaign to usher in as many illegals as possible on an unprecedented scale in order to achieve permanent one-party rule.  Treason.

Illegal aliens are counted in the census and are included when determining the distribution of congressional seats, even though they are not eligible to vote.

I don't believe Community Notes are intended for people's opinions. Musk's post was clearly an opinion. 
Please stop abusing Community Notes.

Democrats aren‚Äôt importing illegals to swing states for a 1-party system. Immigrants don‚Äôt vote; citizens do. Electoral shifts come from policy & turnout, not a grand conspiracy.

NNN. CBone was used to import 1m unvetted illegals. Tax dollars were provided to NGOs to facilitate millions more crossing the border illegally. The data supports Musk's stated opinion.

There is no evidence of a coordinated effort to allow illegal immigration for one-party rule. U.S. law defines treason as waging war against the country or aiding its enemies. Claims of a political party engaging in such actions are unsubstantiated.
