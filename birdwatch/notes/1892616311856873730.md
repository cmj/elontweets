Either Zelensky holds an election to prove that he represents the will of the people or he is a dictator. | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1892616311856873730

NNN. This is a personal opinion of Elon and wikipedia is not a source.

Theoretically, martial law could be in place to keep leaders in power but it would not be democratic, especially there has been extended period of time. The note should be taken into the comments.

Holding elections during a military invasion risks security threats, voter suppression, logistical failures, and legitimacy concerns.

Enemy forces could disrupt voting, exploit divisions, or challenge results, weakening national unity and governance at a critical time.

The Constitution of Ukraine forbids elections while martial law is in place.

Zelenskyy is not a dictator, but a legitimate democratically elected President of Ukraine with 73% of the vote, defeating Petro Poroshenko in 2019, who's opposition party is not banned. 

The Law https://www.global-regulation.com/translation/ukraine/571687/on-the-legal-regime-of-martial-law.html Article 19. vorbids elections during martial law.
