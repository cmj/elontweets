Zelenskyy is not a dictator, but a legitimate democratically elected President of Ukraine with 73% of the vote, defeating Petro Poroshenko in 2019, who's opposition party is not banned. 

The Law https://www.global-regulation.com/translation/ukraine/571687/on-the-legal-regime-of-martial-law.html Article 19. vorbids elections during martial law.
