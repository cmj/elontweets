True, money printing for government spending causes inflation.  Reduce spending  reduce inflation rates.

The causes of inflation are not widely agreed upon and open to debate. To imply government spending is the only cause of inflation is inaccurate.

Inflation can result from demand exceeding supply (demand-pull) or from rising production costs (cost-push). Factors include money supply, wages, commodity prices, and expectations of future inflation.

Data shows that most cases inflation correlate negatively with government deficits, which pick up in recessions, when inflation tends to be the lowest

Inflation correlated well with energy prices and measures of supply chain disruptions, like the shipping cost indices

Inflation results from money supply expansion relative to productive output.

Both private and public lending increase the money supply.

Private debt to GDP in the US is nearly double federal debt to GDP but varies with economic conditions.
