This is not the right post to community note. This seems to be a direct abuse of CN. If you honestly want to CN a post, do so with the Original Post unless a repost adds incorrect context.

The word "exactly" is a personal opinion. NNN.

The original post says nothing about illegal immigration specifically, and only talks about a general immigration crisis.

Illegal immigrants can, and often do, apply for asylum and refugee status.

Some NGO’s encourage illegal immigrants to take advantage of these programs.

Refugees are not illegal immigrants and they enter the USA legally after going through an extensive vetting procress. NGO'S that support them have nothing to do with illegal immigration. https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-and-asylum/refugees
