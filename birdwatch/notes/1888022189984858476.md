[Sat Feb 08, 2025 00:29:02 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: Can you believe that universities with tens of billions in endowments were siphoning off 60% of research award money for “overhead”?  What a ripoff! [@NIH] Last year, $9B of the $35B that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) granted for research was used for administrative overhead, what is known as “indirect costs.” Today, NIH lowered the maximum indirect cost rate research institutions can charge the government to 15%, above… https://t.co/FSUYpEGKsr | ↳ 9,331 ⇅ 37,323 ♥ 159,133 🡕 15,543,009 | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1888022189984858476

NNN. Elon is referring to the overhead rates of the other Endowments in the graphic, which are >60%.

NNN - As can be seen in the attached image of the tweet that is quoted, each university had a unique indirect rate. The average was 27%, some went up to ≈70%. It is factual that universities worth billions were siphoning off 60% of research grants for administrative overhead.

Elon is correct.  The 27% figure includes the entire pool of NIH research grants.  Elon specifically referenced universities with billions in endowments, which are indeed using 60% (and more!) of NIH grants for administrative overhead, not the entire pool of NIH recipients.

Most universities, particularly public universities, have endowments considerably smaller than Harvard’s. Indirect costs, which pay for infrastructure and personnel that provide general support for the research (e.g. facility maintenance and biosafety offices).

For a university claim 60% of a grant award as indirect costs it would have to have an indirect rate of 150%.  The largest indirect rates are about 60%, which means 37.5% of a total award is used for indirect costs. Total  cost = [Direct costs + (Direct costs × indirect rate)]

To clarify potential misunderstanding: The indirect rate is calculated relative to direct costs rather than grant totals.

Thus, a rate of 69% means adding 69% of the direct costs of the grant, meaning that 0.69/1.69 ~ 41% of the total grant money goes to overhead.

If $9 billion of $35 billion was spent for overhead, that's 27% (9/35=.267=27%) not 60%. Did Elon miss basic math?https://www.cuemath.com/commercial-math/percentages/
