Elon is attempting to spread political opinions and sensationalism as fact. He is attempting to inflame white people and scare them. He compares whites as a minority in SA as if they are comparable to any minority in terms of wealth and power. https://t.co/9NKWgh4cBG

Elon fails to mention that the minority are 7.3% in South Africa and they controls over 65% of the countries wealth which this wealth was acquired through segregation laws and also own over 70% of the land that was forcefully taken from Africans https://www.gov.za/news/events/commemorative-events/1913-natives-land-act-centenary#:~:text=The%20Act%20restricted%20black%20people,scramble%20for%20what%20was%20left.
