This is not true. Musk's color is not a factor. It's about trade and ownership laws of the LOCAL subsidiary company.

The proposed CN is untrue. StarLink is being excluded from SA markets because Elon Musk is 'white.' This is literally true. He is white & as the majority stock-holder in StarLink, it is excluded. He must sell or GIVE 30% of his stock to SA blacks for SL to enter SA markets.

Current proposed note claims that Musk's race is not a factor, but that can't be proven. That's Musk's opinion. The link provided is just the opinion of the people he's accused, so of course they deny it. That's not proof.
