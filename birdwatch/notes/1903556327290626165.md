A month ago, the South African government passed a law legalizing | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1903556327290626165

This is not true. Musk's color is not a factor. It's about trade and ownership laws of the LOCAL subsidiary company.

Assuming Starlink ZA mirrors Starlink US ownership, with Elon Musk (hypothetically a Black SA citizen) holding 42%, it meets SA’s 30% Black ownership rule under B-BBEE, enabling telecom licensing and legal operations while maintaining the US model. https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_21aeffce-6e0a-499c-a06c-4b1e857cab03.

The proposed CN is untrue. StarLink is being excluded from SA markets because Elon Musk is 'white.' This is literally true. He is white & as the majority stock-holder in StarLink, it is excluded. He must sell or GIVE 30% of his stock to SA blacks for SL to enter SA markets.

Current proposed note claims that Musk's race is not a factor, but that can't be proven. That's Musk's opinion. The link provided is just the opinion of the people he's accused, so of course they deny it. That's not proof.
