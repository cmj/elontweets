There is no evidence that rapes followed by beheadings, or beheadings with filming and sharing, occur with any frequency in Europe. Europol reports confirm such crimes are not frequent in the EU.

NNN. Elon is not claiming that beheadings are happening in Europe.

He’s saying that atrocities are happening regularly in Europe but are often down played by the media and authorities. 

It’s obvious he is not referencing a precise duplication of a specific event.
