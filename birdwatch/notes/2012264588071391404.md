Best Vehicle claim is subjective based on personal choice. Cybertruck might be best for Elon Musk (due to vested interest), but not for everyone

Considering Elon is Tesla's CEO, it is reasonable to assume he knows what he is talking about regarding their vehicles. Furthermore, Elon is not saying that the Cybertruck is the best vehicle overall; rather, Elon is stating his opinion that it is the best vehicle Tesla has made.
