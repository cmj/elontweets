Context: kremlin talking point to paint Zelenskyy as a dictator though Ukraine can‚Äôt hold elections under martial law. The parliament‚Äôs term extends until martial law ending. Opposition leader & public support favors postponement.

Zelenskyy‚Äôs approval is 63.

The latest poll on a hypothetical 1st-round presidential election shows Zelenskyy leading with 44% of the vote despite a plurality of candidates

Zaluzhnyi follows with 21% and an even more uncompromising stance on the need for guarantees

Trump-Putin aligned man is at 4%

Martial Law was instated by decree of the President of Ukraine, i.e. Zelenskyy, with the support of the Rada--Ukraine's parliament.  It can therefore be undone by his decree as well.  He (and the Rada) are maintaining martial law, not Ukraine's Constitution.
