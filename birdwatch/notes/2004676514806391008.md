Missing context: Bonsignore is a 30+ year FDNY veteran. She has experience at the highest levels FDNY as former EMS Chief, and was the first woman to earn a 4-star FDNY rank. She has clear "proven experience", contrary to Musk’s implication.

As indicated in the post, it is Musk’s opinion that a firefighter needs hands on experience to be effective. Musk is entitled to his opinion.  Those who disagree with his opinion should post in the comment section not CN.
