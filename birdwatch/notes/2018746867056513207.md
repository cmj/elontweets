Spain's PM does not fit tyrant's definition. Maybe he's referring to his soulmate Trump.

That a billionaire who helped Trump come to power in 2025 speaks this way about a president of a democracy like Spain from the platform he owns, is perhaps more of a problem than a solution.

There is no indication that Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez is a traitor or a tyrant. 

Rather, Elon Musk's ire seems to also be a result of investigations and raids conducted on X offices in France and the UK.

When two people are engaged in sex, one person, usually the male, inserts their finger in the anal cavity of their partner, and proceeds to wipe particles of feces on the upper lip of their mate.

1. El País is the pseudo official pamphlet of Socialist party since over 30 years ago. 
2. Dozens of facts demonstrating what the post says. Just search "biggest scandals of PSOE" to find MILLIONS of reasons. Also unconstitutional SocialComunist laws

The nickname “Dirty Sánchez” makes a reference to the fact that Spanish PM’s father-in-law owned a well known gay sauna in Madrid, where prostitution was exercised, and profits from this business helped launch his own political career as Socialist leader.
