Bradley Edwards attorney who represented Epstein victims said "The only thing I can say about President Trump is that he is the only person who picked up the phone and said 'lets just talk, I'll give you as much time as you want, I'll tell you what you need to know.'"

He only wrote that the name exists. In fact, Trump's name does exist in the Epstein files. Therefore, while his statement may be controversial, it is difficult to say that he lied.

Evidence shows DJT name is in Epstein's flight logs, there's no indication of wrongdoing. The files were released by Trump's administration on February 27, 2025, contradicting claims they were withheld to protect him. No new incriminating details about Trump have emerged.

Trump is a known sexual predator & close Epstein associate. Trump has been accused of multiple incidents of pedophilia & even made creepy comments about his own daughter Ivanka starting when she was young. He is already known to be mentioned in the "Epstein Files"...

He was also a known associate of Epstein himself so he probably knows who all his fellow pedophiles are.

A lawsuit accused both men of raping a child, there were also witness statements in the case.

G. Maxwell has stated Epstein recorded videos of trump & others with children found in Epstein's safe when agents raided his estate.
