This is a metaphor, a figure of speech. When someone says that a place is dying, it's just an expression. Being sarcastic with a clean sense of humor is not a motion on the grounds to be verbally attacked by fact-checking constantly.

Elon here is sharing a personal opinion.

By definition an opinion can't be "true" or "false"

Opinions can contain exaggerations.

If you don't know what an opinion is, you can read more here:

PS: by "Europe" here, he is referring to the people, and not the continent.
