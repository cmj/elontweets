It is fact, not rhetoric. https://t.co/ib9bIyqKcV [@JTLonsdale] I don‚Äôt get it - the adults are back in charge, why doesn‚Äôt NYC work with ICE and deport the illegals out of their free hotels?  Or else why aren‚Äôt we arresting whomever stands in our way to enforce the law? Clean it up.

Noncitizens cannot vote in federal elections.

New York creates special ballots for noncitizens that have state and local offices only.

"You can vote ... if you: Are a U.S. citizen (some areas allow non-citizens to vote in local elections only)"
