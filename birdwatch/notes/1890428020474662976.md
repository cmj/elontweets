It is fact, not rhetoric. https://t.co/ib9bIyqKcV [@JTLonsdale] I don‚Äôt get it - the adults are back in charge, why doesn‚Äôt NYC work with ICE and deport the illegals out of their free hotels?  Or else why aren‚Äôt we arresting whomever stands in our way to enforce the law? Clean it up.

NNN The community note not needed. It clearly states local. It does not add any context. Clearly an abuse.

It's not accurate to say that non-citizens 'can't' vote in Federal elections. Many non-citizens do. (6.4% in '08)
It is only accurate to say that it is against the law.

It is extremely easy for non-citizens to register to vote in many states, and then the law is not enforced.

NNN. No where in the post are federal elections mentioned. The post itself even says ‚Äúlocal.‚Äù

NNN:  Note not needed.  Poster is giving an opinion.  Take it to the comments.

Noncitizens cannot vote in federal elections.

New York creates special ballots for noncitizens that have state and local offices only.

"You can vote ... if you: Are a U.S. citizen (some areas allow non-citizens to vote in local elections only)"
