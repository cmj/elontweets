@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: A few days ago, a gang of about a dozen young men tried to assault a woman in her car at night in DC. A @Doge team member saw what was happening, ran to defend her and was severely beaten to the point of concussion, but he saved her. It is time to federalize DC. https://t.co/RPHKj7J3ti | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1952836498971344926

Elon Musk’s claim that a DOGE member "ran to defend" a woman in a D.C. carjacking is misleading. Sources say Edward Coristine was by the car, pushed his partner inside for safety, and was beaten. Police intervention stopped the attack; no evidence he "saved" her.

This is untrue. The Washington Post reports the Doge staffer was assaulted by a 15-year-old boy and girl from Maryland who were trying to carjack him.

Elon Musk used incendiary language in his post. Which is misleading, Donald Trump used misleading language as well, according to MPD violet crime is down 26%  GROK.

NNN. The notes using Politico and  WaPo as sources truly need to learn to double check everything out of those biased outlets. Elon was correct, it was a large group of youths, the police only managed to arrest two. BB was beaten, and saved the girl from carjacking.

Politico and Washington Post arent reliable sources. In any case, Elon Musk is sharing his opinion of the incident after having knowledge directly from one of the affected parties in the incident. It stands on a higher footing than media companies who  often sell lies for clicks.

The first proposed note using Politico is borderline slanderous. The source includes that 10 people were involved in the assault, and also that he got his companion to safety in the car, which fits the definition of being saved from violence. Slander is abuse.

Proposed note uses a source that is gated behind a pay wall so independent verification is not possible without users subbing. Due to this, the proposed note should be considered invalid. New, publicly accessible and reliable source is needed.
