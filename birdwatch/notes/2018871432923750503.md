The people who will be awarded with the residence will not have the posibility to vote in the elections. You must have the nationality to do it. https://www.derechoshumanos.net/constitucion/articulo23CE.htm

Mr. Sanchez has NEVER won any elections. He is in power by "a deal between losers."

It's right. A regularized immigrant can vote in general and regional elections once they acquire Spanish nationality. The period to acquire that nationality is 10 years of residence, or 5 years (for refugees), 2 years (for Latin Americans), and even 1 year in other cases.

They'll have the right to vote only in the regional elections without nationality but as Irene Montero said, they want to nationalize them as a next step. So the original post is in fact valid given Montero's words.
