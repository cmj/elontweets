BBC license fee is a tax. So, yes, BBC is literally state- 
funded.

NNN- OP is correct in spirit. Yes, BBC Media Action is a charity. But the point of the charity is to fund media entities globally. Anyone upset about USAID funding the BBC proper would also be upset about the US funding global media. Added context changes little here.

The BBC is not state funded, as Elon has accepted previously.

Although the Government sets the level of the licence fee, the funds come directly from every UK household that owns a television receiving device, not from government funds/general taxation.
