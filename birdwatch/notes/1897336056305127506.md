[Wed Mar 05, 2025 17:19:01 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)„Äêùóï„Äë: There are still almost twice as many credit/purchasing cards as people in the government, and the limits are $10,000!  A lot of shady expenditures happening. [@DOGE] Weekly Credit Card Update! Pilot program has been expanded to 16 agencies to audit unused/unneeded credit cards. After 2 weeks, ~146,000 cards have been de-activated. As a reminder, at the start of the audit, there were ~4.6M active cards/accounts, so still more work to do. https://t.co/Gi907TqXWZ | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1897336056305127506

The OP refers to a list of credit & travel cards listed for civilian agencies, & therefore it is false to conflate this list with travel cards for military service members. Furthermore, most of the military is not issued a travel card, & would not make the point the CN claims.

NNN.  OP refers to "credit/purchasing cards" which encompasses multiple payment card types. Proposed added context focuses only on headcount.

There are approximately 2 million servicemembers (active/reserve) in addition to 2+ million government employees. Almost all of them are issued a Government Travel Charge Card for travel expenses (transportation, meals, lodging, etc.) during temporary duty or training.  https://www.travel.dod.mil/Programs/Government-Travel-Charge-Card/Cardholders
