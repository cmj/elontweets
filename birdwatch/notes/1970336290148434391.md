Stats are skewed and appear intentionally misleading

Stats come from UK data (2021 census etc): ~103 female sex offenders / 30.4M women ≈3 per million; ~13,234 male / ~30M men ≈395-441 per million (varies by source); ~92 trans women / 48k trans women ≈1,916 per million.

Shut the hell up with these NNN - retweeting for visibility by the website owner is intended to spread factually incorrect or misleading information which the entire community notes system is here to fight against.

NNN, post is a personal opinion reacting to data. Also the top note thinks per capita is "skewing stats". Lol.

Perceptive Brook Wader’s note supports the original post. Did he/she choose Misleading by mistake?

Note not needed on this post

"Wow" is a word used to express a feeling. It's personal opinion.

If the original post (by @EndWokeness) contains misleading information, a community note should be added to the original post, not to the repost.

NNN, proposed note includes data that confirms the information in the X post. Proposed note asserts that said data is "skewed" and "misleading" but fails to say why it is so, or provide any substantiation.
