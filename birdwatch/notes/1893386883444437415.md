NNN. I know liberals hate Elon Musk now, but the abuse of community notes is astonishing. He is leading an effort and literally tweeted his plan. There's nothing to correct or add context about. Grow up immediately. CN should ban nefarious Noters as well.

Musk is stating a letter will be sent out, to the federal employees, soon.

There is no note needed to attempt correction for something that hasn't even been sent yet.

Important Context: The email does not indicate that failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.
