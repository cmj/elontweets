It is not neccesarily claimed that the volume of a sphere was derived only 287 years ago - just Euler presented this formula 287 years ago with is described as being 'so recent'

The CN should go on the original post that Elon retweeted, not Elon's own post. Elon is only expressing a personal opinion that this happened recently. Go upvote the suggested CN on the original if you think this context is important.

The formula for the volume of a sphere is not recent: Archimedes derived it around 225 BCE, more than two thousand years ago, in his treatise ‚ÄúOn the Sphere and Cylinder‚Äù.
