NNN- Israel has no constitution, relying on Basic Laws and judicial precedents. Its Supreme Court has extensive authority to review government actions, which some critics say is excessive. Corruption can occur in any institution, including the judiciary. See:  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Israel

Israel‚Äôs Supreme Court preemptively tackles corruption with wide authority, while the U.S. Supreme Court reacts within a strict constitutional frame, often deferring to Congress or states. 

Israel is on the brink of loosing it's Democracy!
It's Supreme court = last barrier.
