[Sat Feb 01, 2025 10:49:54 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)„Äêùóï„Äë: Exactly [@njhochman] This is arguably the single most important aspect of Trump's funding freeze. The immigration crisis isn't an accident. It's a well-oiled system, facilitated by powerful NGOs‚Äîand funded by your tax dollars. By defunding the NGOs, Trump is crippling the entire system. üßµ https://t.co/OJs1GN0O3y | ‚Ü≥ 4,530 ‚áÖ 23,864 ‚ô• 116,366 ü°ï 9,696,381 | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1885641720961900721

This is not the right post to community note. This seems to be a direct abuse of CN. If you honestly want to CN a post, do so with the Original Post unless a repost adds incorrect context.

The word "exactly" is a personal opinion. NNN.

"United Nations agencies partnered with hundreds of private nonprofit groups to direct billions of mostly US-taxpayer dollars into supporting historic illegal southern border crossing levels during President Joe Biden‚Äôs term in office."

The original post says nothing about illegal immigration specifically, and only talks about a general immigration crisis.

Illegal immigrants can, and often do, apply for asylum and refugee status.

Some NGO‚Äôs encourage illegal immigrants to take advantage of these programs.

Refugees are not illegal immigrants and they enter the USA legally after going through an extensive vetting procress. NGO'S that support them have nothing to do with illegal immigration. https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-and-asylum/refugees
