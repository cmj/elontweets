It includes nothing misleading.  Unless people want a Community Note to challenge:
- ‚Äòinappropriate statements‚Äô, or
- ‚Äònow deleted pseudonym‚Äô

The sources claiming a biased "july-algorithm-change" rely to one single study, that ist highly fraudulent.

NNN. This is a poll of an opinion/statement and is an abuse of CN.

NNN. Nothing about Elon's post is misleading. No context is required. Also, you and every other USAID employee just got fired, so you should probably get off X and start polishing your resume.

Desear√≠a que Elonk Musk viniera a la Rep√∫blica Dominicana y me gustar√≠a tener la oportunidad de conocer ese genio . 

Entonces si el no puede venir a mi pa√≠s me gustar√≠a ir a conocerlo si √©l me asegura que puede recibirme

Elon Musk surveys have never worked as all are biased, only appearing to his followers. He needs to fix X rules, algorithm so that surveys appear even to people that mutted or blocked him. 

Also removed the context of DOGEüê∂ staffer Marco Elez backlash being racist posts.

Note is definitely needed on this. One of the check boxes we use is "provides important context".  The OP leaves out the very reason for the controversy. Providing a note that adds the context is exactly what community notes, formerly "birdwatching", is for.

Missing important context: Mario Elez resigned from DOGE for posts like:
- ‚ÄúJust for the record, I was racist before it was cool,‚Äù
- ‚ÄúNormalize Indian hate,‚Äù and
- ‚ÄúI would not mind at all if Gaza and Israel were both wiped off the face of the Earth.‚Äù
