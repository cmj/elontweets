[Fri Feb 14, 2025 06:10:19 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: I’ve had a top secret clearance for many years and have clearances that themselves are classified.  That said, FAR too much information is made “classified”. If something is easily found online or patently obvious, it should NOT be classified. This impedes effective… [@TONYxTWO] This moment from the USAID House Hearing is 🔥🔥🔥!!! “@elonmusk does have a security clearance, he has a top secret security clearance, by God he makes the rockets for NASA! But the suggestion that he somehow can’t be trusted to dig in to how we’re spending our money is nothing… https://t.co/i4CZ3BY3vC | ↳ 6,574 ⇅ 36,799 ♥ 165,722 🡕 16,821,163 | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1890282404897534089

Proposed note states that Top Secret is the highest government security clearance level. This is absolutely incorrect. 

Elon is correct - there are classification levels whose names are classified at the same level and thus not known to the public.

"Top Secret” is the government’s top level of clearance, but it does not automatically confer access to classified programs.

Secrets the government deems more sensitive are managed in "Special Access" programs. Musk does not have this access, even within his own companies.
