While characterizing this decision as positive is an opinion, it‚Äôs misleading to do so while posting this article, which describes the move as negative.

Context is necessary to make clear that the framing of the article directly contradicts the framing of the post.

NNN. Neither the headline nor Musk address where the water is going. Simply that because of Trump‚Äôs orders the dams were opened.

This is water that was meant to be saved during the winter so that farmers would have it during the summer drought. None of this water is even going to LA.
