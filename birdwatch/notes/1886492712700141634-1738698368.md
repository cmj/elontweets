NNN. Getting money from USAID through an intermediary is still getting money from USAID. The fact that it is not given directly from USAID is unimportant to the overall issue.

There is no proof Jamie Raskin got money from USAID

Elon Musk spent over $250 million to get Donald Trump elected. He was rewarded with a powerful position as head of the DOGE department and direct access to the US president. https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/05/politics/elon-musk-trump-campaign-finance-filings/index.html

There’s no proof that those politicians are corrupt, and without evidence, it could be libel. DOGE has no power to close an agency; Congress does.

Us Congressional Representatives do not receive money from USAID. 

The money is earmarked to distribute and administer humanitarian and educational aid (soft power) abroad.
