NNN. Calls for violence are illegal if "(1) the advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action, and (2) is likely to incite or produce such action". Opinions on whether or not any of the Redditors crossed the line should be debated in the comments. https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/395/444/#:~:text=Ohio%2C%20395%20U.S.%20444%20(1969)&text=A%20state%20may%20not%20forbid,incite%20or%20produce%20such%20action.

The ‚ÄúTrue Threat Doctrine‚Äù explicitly says that a person who would reasonably feel threatened of harm justifies prosecution of the perpetrator. ‚ÄúPink mist them all‚Äù is a matter of opinion whether or not that applies and not just up to the original CN author.

In the United States (U.S.), advocating for violence is not illegal unless it incites "imminent lawless action". Because those Redditors were not inciting imminent action, their speech does not violate U.S. law.
