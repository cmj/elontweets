The inquiry by Rupert Lowe is not an "official government inquiry". It is crowdfunded. 

Official government inquiries are done under the Inquiries Act 2005 and initiated by the government. The inquiry by Rupert Lowe has no obligation to follow any legal standards.

NNN - If any victim wants to take out a civil action and Elon wishes to financially support this, UK law permits this!

NNN, Elon has already helped the inquiry (could be legally, or providing resources) as per OP himself, and Elon is now offering financial support for the same.

NNN - There is an official UK government inquiry. The fact Elon has reposted a different enquiry is irrelevant. He is expressing a personal view/making a personal offer.
