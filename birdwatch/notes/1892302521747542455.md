Lira spoke out against the Ukrainian regime headed by Zelensky.  He was arrested and mistreated in prison. Thus, murdered indirectly or directly. https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/world-int/24744-the-tragic-end-of-gonzalo-lira-a-voice-silenced-in-ukraine.html

Gonzalo Lira was arrested after spreading Russian propaganda. He was released on bail but arrested again after trying to flee Ukraine.  He died of pneumonia in prison. 

There's not any evidence he was murdered, unlike the many examples of foes of Putin who have been killed.
