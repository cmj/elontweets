No Note Needed 
Elon Musk said: "as its own dedicated app" and not Android. That's correct. It's available on iOS.

NNN.  Next you'll be telling us it's not going to be available on BlackBerry

Elon: "we made it so you can do a thing now"

NNN - The app can indeed be downloaded on ios devices, Elon did not specify android devices at any point, he simply said that it can be downloaded, so the post is factually correct.
