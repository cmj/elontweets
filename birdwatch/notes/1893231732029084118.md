Extra Context:
Gonzalo Lira reportedly died in a hospital of pneumonia.

Accusation of malpractice come from his handwritten letter which states: 
"All this started in mid-October, but was ignored by the prison. They only admitted I had pneumonia at a Dec. 22 hearing"

The man was not a journalist. Gonzalo died of pneumonia while in jail. The idea that he was tortured and killed by the Ukrainian state is spread as propaganda by Russia.

False claim. Ukrainian state arrested him, not the executive, he tried to escape illegally violating the bail, was taken to prison and there he caught a disease from which he died in the hospital.

His father accused, without evidence, that was the fault of Zelesnky and Biden.
