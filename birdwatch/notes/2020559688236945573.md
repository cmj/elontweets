This image fails to credit the photographer who took the photograph from which this is cropped.  This came from Starship Gazer's photo posted February 7, 2026 at https://x.com/StarshipGazer/status/2020277940177760582

Elon Musk owns the company that designed, developed, and manufactured the rocket depicted in the photo.

The person who happened to take the photo is irrelevant.
