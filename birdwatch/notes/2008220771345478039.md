@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: Walz replaced the Minnesota state flag with the Somalia flag. That’s part of why he deserves the name “Traitor Tim”. Put the flag back. | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/2008220771345478039

Note needed, while they're similar in that they both feature a white star on a blue background, OP's framing is that the similarity was intentional. While in reality the new state flag was inspired by a public entry in a contest which looks nothing like the flag of Somalia.

This is not the Somalia flag. It is the state flag of Minnesota.

That is not the flag of Somalia. The current flag of Minnesota has an 8-pointed star with an abstract rendering of the state in navy blue, while the flag of Somalia is just a star on a baby blue field. While both flags are similar in appearance, such is 100% coincidental.

Elon is likely pointing out similarities between the Tim Walz-led Minnesota flag redesign and the Jubaland State of Somalia's flag.

Elon is likely referring to the fact that the new design of the Minnesota flag, is reminiscent of that of Somalia.

Both flags are now blue with white stars, although the design of the star is not the same.

The flag design was changed in 2024.
