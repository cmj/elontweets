Being named in the Epstein files does not imply guilt or criminal conduct. The documents include many individuals without accusations. There is no evidence that Elon Musk visited Epstein’s island or committed any crime.

If you search the files for Obama you get 2575 results. The number of mere mentions of a name in the entirety of the Epstein files is irrelevant absent directly damning information.
