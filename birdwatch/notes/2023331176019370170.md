C.S. Lewis is attributed to this quote most likely made by John Trainor.
Lewis did not have children; however, he was a step-parent and heavily involved in their lives. He continued to raise them after their mother died.

Musk didn’t make the quote, he shared and by sharing agrees despite the original poster citing the wrong person.

As a result no note is needed. Elons agreement has nothing to do with his kids, it has to do with his agreement of the sentiment regardless of its author
