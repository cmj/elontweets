NNN -the OP (Musk) is clearly referring to Zelensky's acting job as 'President', surely it's obvious how he got the role?

Zelensky is the founder and owner of the media production company Kvartal 95. He was an executive producer of his movies and TV shows

Zelensky could not fire himself from a job at his own media company
