[Wed Feb 19, 2025 21:24:25 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)„Äêùóï„Äë: Good question [@libsoftiktok] THROWBACK: Zelensky claims Ukraine only received around $75 billion of the $177 billion in aid that was sent from the United States. Where did our money go? Who is lying? We need a full audit of all our money that was sent to Ukraine. https://t.co/IHMLGfOF5h | ‚Ü≥ 4,974 ‚áÖ 9,399 ‚ô• 45,966 ü°ï 4,237,315 | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1892324383173099791

According to Grok only about $75 billion was actually sent/spent.  The larger figure of $177 billion is the total amount pledged, even though less than half was actually sent.

In the video Zelensky mentions that ~$75 billion in funding went straight to the army, whereas the rest doesn't fund the Ukrainian army but social and humanitarian programs.

Nothing nefarious is happening: weapons sent to Ukraine are pulled from U.S. stockpiles, aid money is spent replenishing those stockpiles.   

Small percentage of aid is money transferred to Ukraine, vast majority goes back into the U.S. economy
