There are twelve states with no Democrat representatives, vs. the nine with no Republicans. Thus the data supports the opposite conclusion from what is claimed: Republicans gerrymander more.

What the OP is missing is that there are actually more states with zero Democrat representatives than there are with zero Republicans. So the truth is the opposite of what is conveyed: Republicans gerrymander more.

There are 6 states with one district, 4 of which are Republican seats, 2 are Democratic seats.  The CN is misleading by leaving out that piece of contextual information.
