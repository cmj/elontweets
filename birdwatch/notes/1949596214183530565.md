Anglo American "forces" did not end slavery. If anything, they provided the biggest markets for slaves in 1800s, across Pacific and Central/South American colonies. Slavery was abolished by collective global efforts.

Achaemenids ended slavery as it prohibits free will, the main tenant of Zoroastrianism.

"I prevent slavery & my governors, subordinates are obliged to prohibit exchanging men, women as slaves... Such a tradition should be exterminated the world over."
