@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: Slavery was standard practice throughout Earth until it was almost entirely ended principally by Anglo-American forces in the 19th and 20th centuries. Slavery still exists in some parts of the world btw. I’m not suggesting Britain was purely angelic, but, nonetheless, this is | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1949596214183530565

Anglo American "forces" did not end slavery. If anything, they provided the biggest markets for slaves in 1800s, across Pacific and Central/South American colonies. Slavery was abolished by collective global efforts.

Achaemenids ended slavery as it prohibits free will, the main tenant of Zoroastrianism.

"I prevent slavery & my governors, subordinates are obliged to prohibit exchanging men, women as slaves... Such a tradition should be exterminated the world over."

Hindus and other eastern religions never had slavery. Slavery, and looking down upon other people and religions is an Abhramic concept.

After the abolition of slavery in the British Empire in 1807, the British government paid to free every slave in the empire (25% of all people were in the empire) and the royal navy actively shut down slave routes. This clearly shows that the post is factually correct.
