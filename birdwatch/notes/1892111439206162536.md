NNN, having new elections is a condition of peace. The fact that they're engaged in the war now is irrelevant

NNN - Personal opinion.

The law which limits an election taking place during martial law is Law of Ukraine No. 389-VIII ‚ÄúOn the Legal Regime of Martial Law‚Äù. It is not a part of the constitution, Article 83 only extends power if  their term expires during active martial law.

Zelenskyy won the 2019 Presidential Election with nearly 75% of the vote, promising to bring his country into NATO to stymie further illegal Russian aggression and annexation of its territory.

Russia launched a full scale invasion to remove the democratically elected gov't.

Art.83 of the Constitution of UKR prevents new elections from being held during martial law.

https://hcj.gov.ua/sites/default/files/field/file/the_constitution_of_ukraine.pdf

Martial law was declared in Feb. 2022 and regularly extended by the Rada. Last extension was voted in Feb. 2025.

Cancellation of martial law is a pre-requisite for new elections.

Ukraine is under Russian invasion & the logistics of an election during this period are difficult to orchestrate. 

Ukraine endorses a far greater number of democratic rights than Russia does.

Russia is categorised as ‚ÄòNot Free‚Äô with only 4 out of 40 Political Rights.

You can not hold elections in a country that is in active war. It is in their constitution. So Musk wishes that ukrainians break their constituion.
