NNN, having new elections is a condition of peace. The fact that they're engaged in the war now is irrelevant

The limitation of elections during martial law is not a part of the Ukrainian constitution, it is a limitation imposed by Law of Ukraine No. 389-VIII “On the Legal Regime of Martial Law”, thus, holding an election either during war or martial law would not be unconstitutional.

Art.83 of the Constitution of UKR prevents new elections from being held during martial law.

https://hcj.gov.ua/sites/default/files/field/file/the_constitution_of_ukraine.pdf

Martial law was declared in Feb. 2022 and regularly extended by the Rada. Last extension was voted in Feb. 2025.

Cancellation of martial law is a pre-requisite for new elections.

Ukraine is under Russian invasion & the logistics of an election during this period are difficult to orchestrate. 

Ukraine endorses a far greater number of democratic rights than Russia does.

Russia is categorised as ‘Not Free’ with only 4 out of 40 Political Rights.

You can not hold elections in a country that is in active war. It is in their constitution. So Musk wishes that ukrainians break their constituion.
