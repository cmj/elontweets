NNN  The note and source provided does not prove that other Countries send money to the United States because no Country does.  To properly fact check CN you must remain impartial and that is not happening with Elon.

NNN - Source literally does NOT show even one country who gives money to the United States.

Please explain what “NNN” means as an abbreviation? 
Link is just because “a link “ is required just to ask a question in CN reviews.
