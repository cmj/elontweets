While the reference to a party regularly advocating for the killing of white people is accurate, albeit contentious -  Elon's post referring to White Genocide implies as genocide is taking place, which is not accurate.

This is disinformation by Elon Musk. This has been proven to be false in multiple occasions. Even the claimer has failed to prove his claims. There is no official source claiming the existence of ‘white genocide’

Regardless of labels, violence against white farmers involves brutal, gruesome methods causing extreme agony and terror. The EFF (a major party) led chants of “Kill the Boer”, and said they’re not calling for the slaughter of white people “at least for now”.
