The claim that Muslims in France have a fertility rate of 8.1 is false. According to Pew Research Center, in 2017 it was estimated to be 2.9.

The math should be based on fact, which is 2.9. The claim about Muslims having an 8.1 fertility rate is misleading. 
However, in the video he makes a point that demographic shifts and cultural changes are occurring, raising concerns for some.

More disinformation Elon is platforming. The actual fertility rate among Muslims in France is 2.9 based on Pew Research estimates, not 8.1. The figure in this video taken from an unsourced fake news article, is exaggerated by 179%.

The proposed notes should go to the original post Elon is quoting, the one with the video. Elon's post, on itself, contains no misinformation.
