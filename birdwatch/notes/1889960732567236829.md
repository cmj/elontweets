Unnecessary and misleading note. A specious comparison: Musk sends NASA capsules and government satellites into space.

MUSK'S companies just last year, in 2024, received $3.8 billion worth of US taxpayers money in the form of federal government contracts, in the last five years $13 billion worth, and in total at least $20billion.
