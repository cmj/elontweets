In France, Justice is independant (art.64 of the 1958 Constitution). This search is led by the french justice (Parquet de Paris), independantly from the political system, based on an investigation started in 2025 against X, so the author's claim is invalid.

NNN - It has somehow managed to escape the CN author's formidable intellect that claims of political independence can exaggerate the neutrality of the Parquet de Pari, which is subordinate to the executive branch of their government (Macron).

The fact that justice is independent from the government in France does not mean it can't be politically biased. 
While it remains open for debate, the author is not the first to express such opinion.

NNN - Elon is clearly expressing an opinion, no CN is needed, keep your opinions in the comments.
