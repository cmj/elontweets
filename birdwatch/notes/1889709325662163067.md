NNN. The opinion by the noter is just that, opinion. NPR is not a reliable source and soon to be defunded for articles such as the one above. They are propagandists and so is the noter. Go to the lib alternative so you‚Äôll have your echo chamber. Your bullshit won‚Äôt fly here.

While DOGE and President Trump have alleged fraud, this has not been proven.  Reported examples from DOGE do not appear to be actual fraud but rather spending that they believe is wasteful.

Additionally, the President can‚Äôt withhold funds appropriated by Congress.
