@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: Waiting for Dutch authorities and then the EU to approve. Very frustrating and hurts the safety of people in Europe, as driving with advanced Autopilot on results in four times fewer injuries! Please ask your governing authorities to accelerate making Tesla safer in Europe. | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1932830806596280570

The claim made by Musk about the safety of Tesla autopilot is sourced from statistics published by Tesla, which don’t control for factors like road type, demographics and age of the car.

"...four times fewer injuries" than average traffic, including drunk drivers, drivers on drugs, people w/o drivers licence, car thieves, police under pursuit, and other high crash frequency drivers.

That is actually not an impressive track record. At all.

Tesla’s 8 cameras provide 360° visibility up to 250m and Tesla Vision reduces crashes but requires driver supervision due to limitations in poor conditions [1,2]. The underfloor battery pack lowers rollover risk, enhancing occupant safety (NHTSA 5-star) [3,4]
