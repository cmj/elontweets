Not just an emoji. If he OP quotes an external source, it is the primary source here, and can be therefore CNed for the quote.
If it wasn't so, there would be a flaw in the CNs system, and fakes could be spread avoiding CNs just by the trick of quoting external sources.

In my opinion, community notes are correct incorrect information. This is a statement by the president where he is making a political argument. Disagreements should be put in a reply. Not a community note.

NNN. OP is a salute emoji. Even if CN was needed, it should go on the quoted post

The 8-10 day mission began in June, complications delayed their return. By Sept. they were expected to leave the space station in late Feb. 2025. In Dec. NASA said they wouldn’t return until late March at the earliest. Trump is asking for immediate return in the post.

NNN. NASA, as it's publicly known & established, extended the astronaut's stay when it became clear Boeing couldn't return them as planned.

What’s crucial at this point is the rescue of the stranded astronauts. Every other claim and counterclaim can wait. The President has used his wisdom very well by entrusting the mission to Mr. Elon/ @SpaceX

The two astronauts referenced are not stranded. Since the arrival of Spacex's Crew-9 Dragon, they have a safe ride home.

The plan is for Crew-9 to remain on station until Crew-10 arrives which is more practical for NASA.

This was established when Biden was still president.

NASA had planned back in September 2024 for SpaceX to bring the two astronauts back to Earth in February 2025. 
They had to wait until the other astronaut and cosmonaut finished their scheduled stay.
