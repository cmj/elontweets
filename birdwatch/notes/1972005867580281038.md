@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: Shame on Sky News for this utterly misleading headline. Anyone pushing this false narrative deserves complete contempt. Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED, yet they name me even before Prince Andrew, who did visit. | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1972005867580281038

In a post on "X" Elon Musk has stated that although he was invited to Epsteins Island, he declined the invitation, and did not go, therefore this is a "non" story, and Elon Musk should not be mentioned at all in the headline.

The headline is not misleading. Musk is mentioned by name in the documents.

NNN - MISLEADING IS NOT THE SAME AS INCORRECT, he was ”named in” the files, but the headline makes it seem that Elon went to Little St. James when there is no such claim being made. Thus misleading
