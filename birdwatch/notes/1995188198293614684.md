Grokipedia is not open source. 

According to Grokipedia's own definition, open source refers to open source software. xAI has not made the source code available on GitHub or anywhere else, and unofficial GitHub repos are clearly not the real thing.

Note not needed (NNN). Grokipedia.com is a free online resource and is open to the public for use, thus open source. No one has to pay subscription or license to use. Its being open source as stated by Elon Musk is entirely different from that of an open source code.

Musk didn't claim that Grokipedia's source code is open source, he claimed that Grokipedia.com content is open source, which is factually correct
