NNN - What the program was "designed" to do and what it was actually used to do are two very different things. That is why the government should not fund private media at all.

NNN.  OP is quoting from the official government documents.  His remarks are his opinions.  Make any disagreements or opposing arguments in the comment section. Also, when the funding was provided has no bearing on this.  The funds were authorized by the DOD, not Trump.

The program that Reuters was paid for was designed to defend against large scale social engineering and deception, not encourage it. 
The program began in 2018 under the Trump administration and ended in 2022.
