Actually no note is needed on either of the posts.
This rampant abuse of CN wasting everyone's time with this political bias nonsense needs to stop.
Disagree with Elon? Post it in the comment section.
Enough is enough.

Elon is not the one who made the claim so the CN belongs on the original post not on the post where Elon is asking where did the money come from? All mentioned have net worths higher than what their salary would alllow.

None of these salaries are true as can be discovered on annual filings and disclosures.
