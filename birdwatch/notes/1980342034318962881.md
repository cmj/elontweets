Signal uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE). Messages are encrypted on device and only decrypted on the recipient’s device; servers (including cloud servers like AWS) relay ciphertext and can’t read content. Signal doesn't claim to be decentralized, only E2EE and open-source.

Signal is not decentralized, they rent server infrastructure from AWS and other cloud providers. However, all messages are end-to-end encrypted and unable to be accessed by Amazon or Signal themselves.

NNN - No claims about E2EE are made, so note not needed on that. 

Post is a personal opinion, also not noteworthy. 

When signal claim they rent server capacity from multiple vendors, its a valid reason to criticize AWS outage taking signal down as single point of failure.
