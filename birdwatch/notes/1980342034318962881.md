Signal uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE). Messages are encrypted on device and only decrypted on the recipient’s device; servers (including cloud servers like AWS) relay ciphertext and can’t read content. Signal doesn't claim to be decentralized, only E2EE and open-source.

Signal is not decentralized, they rent server infrastructure from AWS and other cloud providers. However, all messages are end-to-end encrypted and unable to be accessed by Amazon or Signal themselves.
