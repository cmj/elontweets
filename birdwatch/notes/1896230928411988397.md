NNN-This is an analogy for wars, in general. It is clearly unimportant and irrelevant whether any of the current "leaders" in talks about a war that has killed hundreds of thousands actually ate a meal together. OP is making a point about war, all war, not simply Ukraine.

No note is needed on this post. Wars are entered into to by rich leaders, but it's  the poor people who  suffer and die.  Whether or not the leaders actually ate dinner or not is irrelevant.

The meeting ran from 2pm to 4pm local time. It was talks, without a meal. This source is generally friendly to the OP's outlook, so is worth considering:

Important context: Donald Trump invited Emmanuel Macron, Keir Starmer, and Zelenskyy for meetings over a meal all in the past week.

Weggelassen: Russland startete den Krieg 2022. Zelenskys Treffen mit der EU folgten US-Drohungen, Hilfen zu k√ºrzen. Putin bleibt unerw√§hnt.

Elon Musk is personally responsible for at least 13 children never seeing their father.
