The video shows a Tesla Cybertruck beating a Porsche 911 in the 1/8th mile, not the 1/4 mile as claimed.

The cybertruck did not beat the 911 as claimed. In this video it shows the proof:

The YouTube video from Engineering Explained clearly stated that their trailer weighed more than Tesla's, their 911 was set farther back on the trailer, and their trailer tongue height was higher...all of which invalidates their comparison.
