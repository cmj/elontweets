The video finish line is at 1/8 mile, not a quarter mile. Tesla said they did not tow for a full 1/4 mile. In independent tests, the Porsche 911 beat the Cybertruck over a quarter mile.

Grok explains how Tesla engineering arrived at this claim and how it is unverified.

The video shows a Tesla Cybertruck beating a Porsche 911 in the 1/8th mile, not the 1/4 mile as claimed.

The cybertruck did not beat the 911 as claimed. In this video it shows the proof:

The video does not claim that the track is 1/4 mile. It is showing the Cybertruck's general speed stats at the end, not claiming that the track in the video is 1/4 mile.

The YouTube video from Engineering Explained clearly stated that their trailer weighed more than Tesla's, their 911 was set farther back on the trailer, and their trailer tongue height was higher...all of which invalidates their comparison.
