[Mon Feb 24, 2025 21:28:45 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)„Äêùóï„Äë: Twitter added far more features with fewer people.  What really matters for improving American‚Äôs standard of living is shifting people from low productivity jobs in government to high productivity jobs in industry.  Many more people needed in manufacturing! [@GuntherEagleman] I support DOGE firing 80% of the federal government employees.  It worked for Twitter. | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1894137412801978375

NNN Elon‚Äôs post talks about more features added to X with fewer people. It does not talk about growth or revenue.

According to Elon Musk himself, growth on X is stagnant and revenue is unimpressive. The platform is barely breaking even, therefore is strategy have in fact not worked for X. https://www.thewrap.com/elon-musk-x-growth-stagnant-twitter-revenue/

This user is using the wrong name to refer to this platform. Twitter is not the current name.
