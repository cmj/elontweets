NNN - The CN belongs to the original post. Trumps statement is false as US banks are allowed to to business in Canada.
Musks statement is true. The rules are indeed asymmetric.

Foreign banks can‚Äôt operate on-par with domestic banks.  The Bank Act restricts their activities: no foreign retail branches can accept deposits less the $150K, no securities dealing, limits on branches and ownership rule restrictions. Can banks are unrestricted in the US.

NN. The claim is that American banks can't operate in Canada. They can. They have to follow the regulations, but the claim "they can't operate" is fundamentally false.
