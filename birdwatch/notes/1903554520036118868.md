Gender transition, a well established medical procedure, does not result in death. 

Elon’s child, who is now referred to as Vivian, is still alive and well.

Note needed. How is "dead" an expression of an opinion? Some NNNs are unreal.

A person is either dead or alive, and Musk is giving the impression that his son actually died - which is factually incorrect.

NNN - He is clearly expressing his own opinion and he doesn't mean someone literally died.

Per common trans culture the original person dies or is killed by the "new" person frequently.
'Vivian' has referenced this behavior previously as well.

NNN.  The post is opinion. "Dead" is an expression of opinion. It is akin to people that use the term "dead naming". That doesn't include physical death, either.
