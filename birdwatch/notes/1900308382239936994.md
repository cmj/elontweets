Le transfert des compétences des États vers la commission européenne s'est accéléré ces dernières années. Les gouvernements sont en accord pour ce transfert. Le problème est: référendum de 2005 français écarté par les élus français; la commission outrepasse ses compétences.https://reporterre.net/Le-traite-de-Lisbonne-est-une-trahison-de-la-democratie

Europe is not a dictatorship; on the contrary, it is a democracy. It’s made by the willing of each country to help each other.

As the name suggests, the United States of America is a federation of states with their own governments. The US Federal Government (whom Elon Musk works for) is far more powerful than the European Commission, e.g. it possesses a monopoly on violence through an army.

Its a joke that exaggerates the EU governance, ironically suggesting excessive bureaucracy. This criticism reflects a real debate on national sovereignty vs. European integration

NNN, This picture is a meme and clearly an opinion. The US can be discussed in the comments if people wish.

According to the Treaty of Lisbon, the EU is neither a federation, neither a confederation. Can't compare it with the US federation. Also, US states retain greater autonomy is some cases than EU member states.

The EU is a country, the EU is not. The president of the United States is democratically elected by citizens. In the EU, citizens do not vote for the European Commission, President of the European Council, or President of the European Commission. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission
