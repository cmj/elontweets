Mr. Musk‚Äôs poll leaves out the option of moving the time 30 minutes, half way between the two other options.

It would be more clear to ask whether one prefers the current summer DST hours or the winter standard hours.  Asking whether an hour later or earlier is not clear.

This poll does not state what will be an hour earlier, the clock face or waking. The clock might be assumed as precedent, but waking may be assumed given the personal nature of the appeal. Note added for the benefit of the OP, and the integral presumed reality of the poll.

Elon Musk‚Äôs poll on DST is inaccurate. It‚Äôs unclear if ‚Äòcanceled‚Äô means standard or DST time, and options are vague. X polls lack science, sampling, controls. Gallup (http://bit.ly/41q4tRi) shows 54% prefer standard, 40% DST, 6% uncertain. Experts (https://bit.ly/4itkYDg) back standard time.

NNN - a badly worded poll does not justify a note on its own. There also isn't anything misleading in asking what you would prefer "if" the daylight savings was done away with.

Stop adding opinions to community notes.

poll's question is not misleading, but not as clear as it could be. It would be much clearer if it asked if the user a) preferred continuing on current winter "Savings" time or b) go through one last "spring forward" into Standard time.

NNN - This is a poll gathering the opinions of users of X.

Logical Wind Kingbird is abusing the Community Notes system and should have their privileges removed

NNN - It's literally just a poll asking for everyone's opinion. There's nothing misleading about the question.

It's funny, the ones trying not note this can't even deduce the meaning of an hour behind and an hour later. Some morons up here in here don't even know basic integers.
