NNN- seriously folks, take your opinions to the comments unless you have some offer of proof that @CommunityNotes did not in fact ‚Äúwin again.‚Äù On a side note, as contributors we should all be glad if and when CN notes do ‚Äúwin.‚Äù It means the system is working.

NNN, personal opinion.

From the screenshot, it's clear that this is only a proposed note, so it's not misleading. Elon is merely expressing a personal opinion about a proposed note.

Community Notes is full of bad notes that are hidden from the general public. High-quality notes that are visible to the general public are those that have been rated Helpful, which the note Musk highlights is not.

Author fails to understand critical distinction between direct and indirect cost. Indirect costs pay for personnel in support of research, research facilities, regulatory compliance, utilities, safety requirements and myriad other critical aspects of research.

Reducing indirect costs won‚Äôt increase direct research funding. Indirect costs cover essential research infrastructure. Cutting them shifts the burden to researchers, increasing inefficiencies and costs. Many top research institutions lack large endowments to offset this loss. https://x.com/jflier/status/1888200334851404045
