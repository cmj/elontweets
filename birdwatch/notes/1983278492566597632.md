This is false. It is against the law to vote if you are not a citizen.  18 U.S. Code § 611.  People weren’t required to show id to vote for most of the country’s  history.

NNN. Something being against the law doesn't make it impossible to occur.

Prosecutions for voter fraud do exist. By definition, not every occurrence of a crime is detected and prosecuted.
