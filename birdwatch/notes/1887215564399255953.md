NNN. Elon has made no comment, and the video has not been edited in a way that is manipulative. As such, it is classified as reporting. If you disagree with the press secretary use the comments.

Nope. Any issues you and the state-funded leftists in legacy media have concerning whether or not the correct bureaucratic procedures have been followed while dismantling the bureaucracy go in the comments. What are the odds USAID is paying community note members?

Note not needed. She is expressing an opinion. Keep the rest of the crap in the comments where it belongs.

this doesn't explain why elon has been given access to confidential information, or the rest of DOGE.  

elon forced his way in after removing members of the gov. intending to protect traditional due process and data privacy laws.

this also misrepresents peaceful protest.
