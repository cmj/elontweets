Hindenburg is the largest flying object at 245m in length. Floating in the air by buoyancy and not aerodynamic lift is still considered flying.
Britannica defines flying as "the act of moving through the air or through outer space"

The Hindenburg is still the largest flying craft humans have built, at ~245m in length and ~40m in diameter vs Starship's ~125m height and ~9m diameter.

>> The Hindenburg was so large that the entire SpaceX Starship with its boosters could fit inside if it were hollowed out.

It's perfectly true to state it as largest. It does not mean longest.
