It aimed to deter frivolous suits, but critics said it shielded executive overreach. Over 190 TROs blocked actions in early 2025. https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/all-info https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_948d77fc-839f-4533-abb5-19bc02205f0a https://5calls.org/issue/hr1-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-budget-reconciliation/ https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr1/text
