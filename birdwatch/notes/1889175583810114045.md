NNN. The 1985 data point is "raised by one or no parent", not single mothers as claimed in the CN.

Prior to 2007, CPS only showed children as raised by two parents if they were married. The post "conflating" the terms is not strictly true. NNN.

Post falsely or erroneously conflates "unmarried" with "single." 44% of Black youth live with mothers only. It was 51% in 1985, not 67%, as falsely or incorrectly claimed.
