This statement is equating progressive “left” political views with mental instability; which is not only illogical, but also discriminatory against a protected class  (women, as stated above).
This is a false cause fallacy.

The author of the other community note clearly did not even read the entire post. There is no statement equating progressive “left” political views with mental instability.
This is just a straw man fallacy.
