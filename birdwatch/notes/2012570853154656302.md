This statement is equating progressive “left” political views with mental instability; which is not only illogical, but also discriminatory against a protected class  (women, as stated above).
This is a false cause fallacy.

This thread presents speculative claims as facts. There is no strong evidence that women’s political shifts are driven by biology or social media “capture”

Most research points to material and structural factors.

NNN: there is nothing misleading or inherently incorrect about stating the opinion that something "is worth studying", and no additional context is required for a personal opinion.

Stop abusing CN by trying to use it in attempt to broadcast your own personal views.

The author of the other community note clearly did not even read the entire post. There is no statement equating progressive “left” political views with mental instability.
This is just a straw man fallacy.
