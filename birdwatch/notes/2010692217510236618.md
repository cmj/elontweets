She does not imply transitioning a one-year-old boy. 

In the tweet Elon is referring to, Ashley mentions her “son’s sister”. 

The son is her child with Elon. The sister she is referring to is one of Elon’s other children (born Xavier, now goes by Vivian).

NNN - Elon refers simply to statements that have been made. The link provided by Humorous Strawberry Partridge contains a statement that may not be one to which Elon is referring.
