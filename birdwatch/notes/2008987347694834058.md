This is presenting an unverified claim as a fact. We do not know her intentions because she was shot and killed by ICE.

The driver tried turning right to avoid contact with the agent. https://x.com/paulg/status/2008989862725341658?s=20

Under objective standards, such as Graham v. Connor, which require an imminent threat to justify deadly force, the footage does not meet this requirement.

ICE claims differ, stating it was defensive.

Based on circulating videos there is 1 ICE agent in front of the drivers car when she starts to accelerate from a dead stop. It is unclear whether the driver was intentionally trying to run over the agent or trying to evade arrest.

Musk is stating as a fact when, until proven otherwise by authorities, it is opinion..

There is no evidence the citizen was trying to cause harm. She was attempting to drive away, when an ICE agent shot her in the face multiple times.

NNN, take your assumptions to the comments. Until a court proceeding of some variety takes place everything else is an opinion.

Whether the drivers intent was to cause harm or not is an opinion. We do not know if she was trying to drive away, that is the CN writers opinion. The video does not prove intention or disprove it. The video does prove they drove in the direction of an agent in front of the car

This person purposefully tried to run an ICE agent over.
