After that, the senate will become supermajority left forever, like California. | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/2014750938913784037

This is simply untrue. Elon Musk said the complete OPPOSITE in the following tweet:

This is an abuse of Community Notes and should be removed.

OP is expressing an opinion.  Notes aren't appropriate on opinions. 

Furthermore, the link used in the proposed note goes to pornographic content.  It is flagrant abuse of CN to write notes and link to such content.
