@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: @reidhoffman The big difference between you and me, Reid, is that you went and I did not. In fact, you went multiple times. First time was maybe a mistake, but not the second time you went. | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/2018923669079335176

CONTEXT: The reason Elon didn’t go is that Epstein cancelled on him at the last minute.

Elon sta pure stato cancellato al ultimo minuto ma questo gli fa solo onore. Vuol dire che non si divano di lui ovviamente se la logica non è un opinione.

NNN…It’s irrelevant on why he did not attend LSJ..Fact is HE NEVER WENT. EVER. Put it the comments and stop using CN for personal opinions. Just because it’s Elon doesn’t make you any cooler.
