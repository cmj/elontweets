Charlie Kirk was a racist & misogynist who said "there's no such thing as racism" "make sure your loved ones are not on birth control" etc:

Winged Apricot Emu's proposed note as well as every note they have written are various forms of manipulative fallacies such as Whataboutism & Deflection. Fallacies have no place on CN.

NNN (fallacy) Winged Apricot Emu is abusing community notes.

NNN. Original post is oppinion. CN also only cites biased sources that specifically quote Charlie Kirk out of context. This CN specifically mimics the kind of behavior that has lead to the breakdown in speach between the left and right in the US as well as Charlie's murder. NNN

NNN - guys, this post is an OPINION about what Elon is claiming to OBSERVE. Take your opinions to the comments. Anyone who writes a note on this will get reported for abusing Community Notes.

The note above points out two of Charlie's opinions that infact prove Elons post correct. There is no such thing as racism would be on the side of light. Not giving your kids birth control also would be considered light. Supporting abortion would be "dark" side of things.
