Claiming the opinion of the [American] public is accurately reflected by a personal account poll is not evidence based.

1) Only 23% of American adults use X (as of 2023).

2) The poll wouldn’t appear to many who don’t follow Musk.

3) Non-Americans (and bots) can vote.

This is a twitter poll, and is in no way indicative of the actual truth , following Musk's own logic he has a 30% approval rate according to the top comment https://x.com/TrueSlazac/status/1898047769815777363

According to recent polls, actual support for DOGE is split with, depending on pollsters and questions, narrow lead for either supporting or not supporting the current efforts. There is also a clear split along party lines, rendering the statement ‚super high‘ misleading.

NNN X polls are uncontrolled and anonymous, so any construing of internal dynamics remains opinion, no matter how rational. Reasonable speculation, affirmed by a result,  is opinion and not deception.

It is a political abuse of CN.

NNN. According to a Pew Research Poll, X is a politically balanced social media platform. Therefore, an X poll with over 1,200,000 respondents, compared with CN cited polls with 200-1200 respondents, can be assumed to be just as, if not more, representative of public sentiment.

I believe the majority of people are in line with the Elon DOGE campaign Polls are and can be very subjective and biased The clip does not purport anything other than the attendees at a meeting and their opinions which in itself may be  biased https://www.pewresearch.org/ https://www.gallup.com/
