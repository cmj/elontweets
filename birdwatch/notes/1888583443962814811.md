[Sun Feb 09, 2025 13:39:15 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)„Äêùóï„Äë: All aspects of the government must be fully transparent and accountable to the people.  No exceptions, including, if not especially, the Federal Reserve. [@WallStreetApes] Why is Elon Musk supporting Ron Paul leading an audit of The Federal Reserve such a big deal? Because The Fed has NEVER had a full audit, or full disclosure of monetary policy decisions Example: The Fed got caught doing HALF A TRILLION in swaps overseas with no oversight‚Ä¶ https://t.co/kXCrzJXs0L | ‚Ü≥ 6,707 ‚áÖ 25,585 ‚ô• 107,466 ü°ï 7,971,535 | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1888583443962814811

Groovy Lake Swift‚Äôs CN is immaterial & irrelevant. 

1. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether the DOGE members are named for them to audit the Fed. 

2. Given the malicious doxing that has already occurred & strong pushback re: audits, it‚Äôs wise to not divulge personnel and methods.

Don‚Äôt worry there will be statues of these people some day. We will add a special section in the Garden of Heroes just for them AFTER they survive the making these changes, which is clearly not something that could happen if everyone knew who they were. NNN

Elon Musk, a special government employee tasked with running DOGE, will not allow transparency into who is part of DOGE and how they are conducting audits and determining ‚Äúfraud, waste and corruption.‚Äù
