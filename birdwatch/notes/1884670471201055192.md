NNN - You're all absolute loonies if you believe gender & sex are different or that there have EVER actually been more than 2 genders. 

Get out of the house more often, straighten your posture, shave your neckbeards, and touch some damn grass.

NNN - not only is this post 
a joke (which doesn’t require CN) it’s also a fact that there are ONLY FEMALE AND MALE as created by Allah. Modifying your body parts doesn’t change that. So, either way, nothing to correct here. Stop abusing CN.

Article on https://link.ucop.edu/ is about cultural roles.
Elon Must post is about biology.

Assigning any cultural role to any sex is wrong, we do not need to create "cultural and social genders". Each male and female could be different, has different roles, jobs etc.

The post, its community notes, and all of the rebuttals to the notes conflate entirely different concepts: biological sex and gender identity. Discussing this issue without distinguishing these criteria—or deliberately conflating them—is misleading and inappropriate.

Saying that there are only two genders is incorrect from several perspectives, especially in sociology, psychology and cultural, social and personal aspects
Gender is not the same as biological sex.
