The attached photo is from Play Store which only exists in Android phones, so unrelated to Apple.

The Screenshot is taken from the Google Play Store, not from the Apple Appstore.

NNN. Play Store competes with App Store (Android vs iOS respectively) and shares many similarities.

Being highly successful in one store while unsuccessful on the other, while possible, is highly unlikely. Which is his point: that Apple is being biased and partial.

The post never claims it is on app store, neither that the ranking is wrong, it just shows options about the app not being listed on official lists from apple. Also, the app is also rated 4.5 stars from around 500k on app store.

NNN - it is also rated 4.9 on the Apple Store, so screenshot aside, the statement is accurate.
