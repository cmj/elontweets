NNN - $50M in condoms for Mozambique at a wholesale price of $.01/ea would buy 5 BILLION condoms. No reason for a note, that's a LOT of condoms.

Alibaba.com shows bulk pricing as low as $.01 per.

NNN the statement is not false. Musk did not say 50 million condos were sent to Gaza. He said 50 million condons was a lot of condons. In the clip there is also clarification that they were sent to Mozambique.

There is no publicly available evidence to support the claim that USAID spent $50 million on condoms in Gaza.
