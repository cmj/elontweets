Nothing nefarious is happening: weapons sent to Ukraine are pulled from U.S. stockpiles, aid money is spent replenishing those stockpiles.   

Small percentage of aid is money transferred to Ukraine, vast majority goes back into the U.S. economy

He’s received $200 billion in total aid from the United States…

He’s specifically stating that only $75 billion of that aid was in military weaponry…

No money has been lost…
