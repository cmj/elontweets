NNN - Per the dictionary, the note above is incorrect. a "Majority" is the "the group or political party having the greater number of votes (as in a legislature)" or " a number or percentage equaling more than half of a total"

Trump did not "win a majority of the country"s vote in the 2024 presidential election.  

Final results, per FEC
- Trump: 77,302,580 votes (49.80%)
- Harris: 75,017,613 votes (48.32%)

Trump beat Harris by 1.48%. Neither candidate won a majority (>50%) of the popular vote.
