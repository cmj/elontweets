@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: @GovPressOffice I assume you’re referring to my son, Xavier, who has a tragic mental illness caused by the evil woke mind virus you push on vulnerable children. I love Xavier very much and hope he recovers. My daughters are Azure, Exa (she goes by Y) and Arcadia, and they do indeed love me… https://t.co/2AQBQEOOIT | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1999379324768788663

Gender dysphoria is not an “illness”. It is a diagnoses. As a result of gender dysphoria, people who are transgender don’t identify with their physical parts in the same way their mind is telling them they are. Trans people have always existed.

Elon Reeve Musk does not have a son named Xavier. Elon seems to be confusing his daughter Vivian for someone else. Likely the result of years of ketamine abuse that removed his ability to think critically or empathize with others. Please keep Elon in your prayers.

Excellent Cherry Sandgrouse (Jordan L 1405) is completely incorrect, Xavier ("Vivian") is NOT female, he is a male. He may identify as a trans woman, but that doesn't change his biology.

Gender dysphoria IS a mental illness, much like anorexia. It's a mental disorder.

Trans identities are historical & real across cultures. But US rates rose sharply: adults +68% (2014-23), youth x5. Some blame social contagion via woke culture's status elevation (Gad Saad). Others say acceptance drives visibility.
