One of the sponsors of the bill, Justin Eichorn, has since been arrested for attempting to solicit sex from a minor and now faces federal charges.  He subsequently resigned from the Minnesota Senate.

The state is not responsible for or qualified to be defining new mental illnesses. Defining new mental illnesses falls primarily to the World Health Organization or American Psychiatric Association. Representatives do not automatically have expertise in clinical psychology.

The post negates to mention that the senator who put this bill forward has since been charged with soliciting a minor for sex after being caught in a prostitution sting.

There is no reason why this post needs to mention that fact about the senator.  Grow up and put it in the comments.
