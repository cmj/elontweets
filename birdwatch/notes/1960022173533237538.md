The police have no information on the suspect except what the victim has told them. Nobody can know until the suspect is known or caught if he's illegal or not. Police are asking for more information from the public because they don't know who he is yet.

There is no mention of an illegal immigrant being a suspect in the article. Radio Europe is presenting an unverified claim as fact and Elon is amplifying it.

NNN. OP gives commentary on the suspicious fact that perp’s description is not disclosed in the article, despite being at large and details are known to the victim, and would assist in apprehension. 

Until speculation the perp is an illegal migrant can be proven false, NNN.
