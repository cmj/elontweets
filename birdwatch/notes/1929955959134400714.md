The link provided in community notes is not the bill, it’s a link to the White Houses summary of the bill. 

Read the actual bill not the people who want it to passes watered down sales pitch version.

It’s factually incorrect to say “this is the bill” when it is not.

The proposed note is irrelevant. Elon Musk makes no mention of "Trump's bill."
