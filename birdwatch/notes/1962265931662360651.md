Three people were arrested. One of them, a woman, was filmed. She was not arrested for waving a Union Flag, but on suspicion of breaching a Section 14 order, as the Civic Centre was outside the designated protest zone.

NNN: the "protest" is merely HAVING a British flag, whether the Union Jack or the St George's flag. She, therefore, was LITERALLY arrested for flying a Union Jack. Stop trying to note people bringing awareness to actual fascism.
