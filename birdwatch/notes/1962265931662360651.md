Three people were arrested. One of them, a woman, was filmed. She was not arrested for waving a Union Flag, but on suspicion of breaching a Section 14 order, as the Civic Centre was outside the designated protest zone.

Elon is also stating his view, any notes belong on the original post.

No community note is needed cause it's just Elon saying the video is crazy, it's not that he's adding to it besides his opinion.

NNN: the "protest" is merely HAVING a British flag, whether the Union Jack or the St George's flag. She, therefore, was LITERALLY arrested for flying a Union Jack. Stop trying to note people bringing awareness to actual fascism.
