This is factually misleading as majority of mass shootings have been from right extremist. He is click baiting.

Note is needed because many observers might not understand that the meme is meant to be satirical. The artist admits that its an overgeneralization - stick figure meme not reflective of reality

Proposed CN relies on manipulation of the definition of mass shootings based on their argument, a common tactic. When discussing gun control- they use the FBI definition that does not include a minimum body count but when discussing demographics, they use body count and intent.

NNN - citing a 2021 report from the ADL is not credible. The ADL is well-known for its political, left-leaning bias. The report itself would need a CN.

NNN. The CN references a study from 2021 which ignores the last 4 years. The graphic in the OP remains mostly correct, or if you rather, a highly controversial but widely held opinion.

Note is left wing bias and ignores recent political assassinations and assassination attempts overwhelmingly coming from the left (Democrats). Note will be hidden. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
