[@JohnMcCloy] This is why the üá∑üá¥ Romanian President was arrested and how this ties in to stamping out ‚ÄúTrumpism/Populism‚Äù.

The source in the proposed CN references Politico, which states: 
"According to Romanian news channel Digi24, prosecutors have issued an arrest warrant for him and have begun searching the premises of his close associates"

If he was detained for 24 hrs‚Ä¶ he WAS indeed arrested. Use your brain, no the Community Notes.

Georgescu got 22,94% in the very tight first round of the pres. election. Candidates #2 and #3 got 19,17% and 19,15%. Being #1 in 1st round doesn't imply being elected in the 2nd round, as shown by the result of the parliament election 1 week after, and prior to annullation.

This is Romania, where the order of events are different.

First 24h is detention, then the prosecutor asks the court for "judicial control." 
Which Mr Georgescu is subject to. Not an arrest.

Disinformation. He was not detained or arrested. He was brought to the General Prosecutor's Office for questioning. The detention is for 24 hours in the first phase and for 30 days afterwards and after that comes arrest.
