The post is intended to show the irregular spike in voters year over year. That mail-in voting is ripe for fraud as it has been proven in so many other countries. Pointing out that the ballets and voter registration doesn’t prove there wasn’t fraud.

Mail-in counts match Census/EAC data (minor rounding). 2020 spike (70M/43%) from COVID no-excuse mail expansions (45 states+DC). 2024 drop (49M/29%) as policies reverted. No widespread 2020 mail fraud per DOJ, audits, bipartisan reviews.
