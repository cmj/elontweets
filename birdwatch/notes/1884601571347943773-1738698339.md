Notes attempting to clarify the legality of the proposed 'Fork' measure belong on the quoted @DOGE post or in the comments. Regardless Musk's post does not claim to be making a statement on behalf of the US Government.

NNN - factual reference
Proposed CN overlooks important citation in OP--information comes not from Musk himself, but is quoted from OPM (US gov't Office of Personnel Management), the ultimate "HR department" for executive branch gov't employees.

This separation is not administrative leave. Pay is severance.

There is no legal authority to permit the federal government to pay employees not to work for this length of time. Per 5 USC 6329a, only ten days of paid administrative leave are allowed per year. Ethics regulations strictly limit outside employment for government workers.

Elon Musk is not a government official and cannot make commitments on behalf of the US government.

In addition, the OPM memo states you can resign and agencies are encouraged to place you on admin leave, but technically if ‘needed’ your agency could work you until then.
