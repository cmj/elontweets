Musk is close to dem. calc. with a Total Fertility Rate of 0.75 over 3 gen, South Korea’s pop falls to 2.69M (5.3%), near Musk’s 3-4%. The decline is real, but Musk exaggerates: a lower TFR (0.6) or no immigration/natalist policies would be needed to reach such decline.

NNN: Elon Musk’s 3-4% claim aligns with a TFR of 0.6-0.7 over 3 generations (75-90 yrs), projecting South Korea’s pop to 1.5-2M (3-4%) by 2100-2115. Current TFR is 0.72, and decline may hit 13.5-21.8M by 2100, not 2.69M (5.3%) in CN’s posted false figures.

NNN: while Musk may have miscalculated the exact rate of South Korea's population decline over three generations, the key message remains the same. Corrections can go to the comment section, in order not the penalize the visibility of the original post.
