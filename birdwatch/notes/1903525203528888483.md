Tesla vehicles have been vandalized in protest of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's suspected Nazi activity; repeatedly giving a Sieg Heil or Nazi Salute at the 47th Presidential inauguration and tweeting support for Germany's far right political party.

Profound Clay Tailorbird, your CN is completely malicious. An abuse of the CN system. Not Not Needed.  Elon is expressing his thanks. There is nothing to correct here. And lastly, I wish those abusing CNs like you are had their CN privileges revoked.
