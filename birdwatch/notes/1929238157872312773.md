@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: All new XChat is rolling out with encryption, vanishing messages and the ability to send any kind of file. Also, audio/video calling. This is built on Rust with (Bitcoin style) encryption, whole new architecture. | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1929238157872312773

Bitcoin does not have encryption only. It uses cryptography.

Encryption scrambles data for secrecy. Cryptography is the broader field of secure communication, including encryption, signatures, and integrity checks.

Encryption is a tool within cryptography.

Musk's mention of "Bitcoin-style encryption" likely refers to the use of cryptographic principles like those in Bitcoin, but Bitcoin's cryptography focuses on securing transactions through public key cryptography for signing and verifying ownership, not encrypting data.

NNN. Elon said, "This is built on Rust with (Bitcoin style) encryption, whole new architecture," and not, "Encryption only." It is not one or the other. He means both. https://www.thestreet.com/crypto/innovation/elon-musk-just-dropped-bitcoin-style-xchat-and-the-community-is-losing-it
