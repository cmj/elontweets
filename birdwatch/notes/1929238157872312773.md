Bitcoin does not have encryption only. It uses cryptography.

Encryption scrambles data for secrecy. Cryptography is the broader field of secure communication, including encryption, signatures, and integrity checks.

Encryption is a tool within cryptography.

NNN. Elon said, "This is built on Rust with (Bitcoin style) encryption, whole new architecture," and not, "Encryption only." It is not one or the other. He means both. https://www.thestreet.com/crypto/innovation/elon-musk-just-dropped-bitcoin-style-xchat-and-the-community-is-losing-it
