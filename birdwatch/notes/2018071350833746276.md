Being mentioned in or having emails included in the Epstein-related document releases does not establish criminal guilt
The released records include contact lists and correspondence, many of which involve individuals not accused or charged with any crime

Steve Bannon has called for prosecutions. 

CONTEXT: Musk’s emails to Epstein asking him “What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?” in 2012 and attempting to schedule a visit again in 2013 have recently been publicized.

There is zero evidence Elon Musk did anything wrong but make an enquiry about attending a party.We cannot know If Elon Musk even attended and should take his denial seriously as he has proven integrity.We cannot hold someone guilty for an unfounded assumption. https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2018071350833746276?s=20

NNN

Personal Opinion 

“Clearly guilty” is an opinion no matter if Elon said it, AOC said it, Biden said it, Trump said it

Your level of disagreement with the opinion does not make it any less of an opinion, which is why it falls under NNN guidelines 

Stop abusing CN

NNN - Clearly just Musk’s opinion on the matter, which is probably true anyways. Other written notes should be on the original post not on Musk’s as it’s just the expression of a opinion, which again probably is true.
