Many listed countries do not allow mail-in voting for residents but permit it for citizens abroad, and some ban claims are inaccurate or not specifically due to fraud. https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/countries-mail-voting-banned/ https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2024/04/fact-check-list-of-countries-where-mail-in-voting-is-not-allowed-is-not-fully-accurate.html https://thedispatch.com/article/assessing-claims-about-mail-in-voting-and-electoral-fraud/

The issue at hand is not whether or not there is 100% fraud or 0% fraud; but whether or not 0.1% fraud is acceptable. Especially with the potential for a margin of victory to be less than 0.1%. Mail in voting is susceptible to convenient fraud, requiring higher scrutiny.

NNN - Vote by Mail & Absentee Voting are not the same thing, despite the terms often being conflated in the US. The OP addresses Vote by Mail only, & not Absentee Voting.

The CN misses the point. The OP is addressing mass mail in voting where every person on the voting rolls is mailed a ballot. Every state always allowed absentee voting when a voter on the voting rolls requested an absentee ballot in advance.
