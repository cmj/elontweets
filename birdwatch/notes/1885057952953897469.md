CN writers have also proposed a noted on the video which, if approved would appear on every post, including this post

üî•üî• is not misleading 
Therefore this post does not need a note

Video is of the actual hearing

Bernie Sanders received $1,417,633 from Pharmaceuticals/Health Products contributions as categorized on Open Secrets for the 2019-2020 election cycle.*

(Some CNs reference less $ because of specific reporting that excludes most of the Pharmaceutical/Health Product industry)

If you‚Äôre going to place (and/or rate) a CN, do it on the original post Musk quoted, not his, which is clearly just an opinion (albeit expressed via emojis). Musk didn‚Äôt add anything that could be considered a statement of fact, so there is no need for a CN.

Proposed note is looking only at 2020 Congressional campaign contributions and not and aggregate from all Congressional and presidential campaigns, which provides the much larger figure.

Note proposed is wrong. Actual amount received by Bernie Sanders from the health sector is 1.274.448$ as the link provided shows, very close to the 1,5 millions RFK Jr. said https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/bernie-sanders/industries?cid=N00000528&cycle=2024

RFK Jr's statement is incredibly misleading. Bernie took 1,274,448$ from the healthcare sector, this however includes 1,264,448$ in small dollar donations from individuals, ie individual doctors, nurses, PA's, ect. For context RFK took 3.2M from health running for president. https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/bernie-sanders/industries?cid=N00000528&cycle=2024

According to Open Secrets, Bernie has received $115,690 from pharmaceutical companies between 2019-2024. Not $1.5 million claimed here.
