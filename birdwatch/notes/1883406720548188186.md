It’s a myth that subways are super efficient. | ↳ 515 ⇅ 374 ♥ 8,625 🡕 671,631 | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1883406720548188186

The article cited provides a cartoon example  of a subway operating under idealized conditions, not an "average" subway, and provides no direct assessment of the Vegas tunnel. There's no reason in principle the Vegas tunnels could not match a subway in capacity.

This is objectively false. Subways have more than 10x the capacity of a road for cars. The average capacity of a single roadway is typically ~2,000 passengers per hour while the average capacity of a subway line is closer to 50,000 passengers per hour
