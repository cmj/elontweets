I OFFERED THIS DIRECTLY to the Biden administration and they refused.  Return WAS pushed back for political reasons.

This is first hand reporting of non-public meetings and therefore notes about the timing of crew 10 are irrelevant. The original crew 9 members Zena and Stephanie would have been able to complete their mission if Butch and Sunni were returned in a separate mission.

Standard mission for ISS are 6 months, as outlined in NASA‚Äôs ISS guidelines. Crew-10‚Äôs readiness and the need for a direct handover to maintain continuous ISS ops influenced NASA ISS ops decision to keep Crew-9 until Crew-10‚Äôs arrival.

NASA prefers that Crew-10 board the ISS before Crew-9 (on which Butch and Suni will return) departs, to assure a sufficient crew is always there to manage the station. The launch of Crew-10 was delayed because SpaceX did not have the originally planned Dragon capsule ready.
