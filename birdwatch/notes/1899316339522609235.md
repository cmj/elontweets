Contrary to the NNN, nowhere in this post does either President Trump or Mr. Musk confer to destruction of property. The post only talks about the boycott which is a form of protest fundamentally protected by the very first amendment of the United States constitution

Unlike what the post suggests, boycotting is a form of peaceful protest and therefore protected by the first amendment

Clarification needed - Elon Musk is going broke and the people have had enough of his rat hands getting involved in U.S. politics.

Trump expressed his personal support for Elon by buying a Tesla in personal defiance of a boycott and Elon thanked him. That’s it.

CNs seem to be hallucinating that they said something else, but they didn’t.

NNN - Destruction of property is not a form of 'peaceful protest,' and is in fact the illegal behavior that OP is referring to.
