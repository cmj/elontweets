Boycotting is not in any way illegal and is a 1st amendment protected activity. As POTUS, he should know this.

Contrary to the NNN, nowhere in this post does either President Trump or Mr. Musk confer to destruction of property. The post only talks about the boycott which is a form of protest fundamentally protected by the very first amendment of the United States constitution

Unlike what the post suggests, boycotting is a form of peaceful protest and therefore protected by the first amendment

Clarification needed - Elon Musk is going broke and the people have had enough of his rat hands getting involved in U.S. politics.

The post shows Elon Musk thanking Trump, who has publicly taken a political position in his favor. We may agree or disagree with Trump, but THERE ARE NO FACTS HERE TO FACT-CHECK! So, instead of community notes, please use the comments to agree or disagree!

Boycotts have turned into protests and actual harm.  In Seattle, four Teslas were torched and Teslas accross the country have been damaged.  That is illegal.

NNN: Tesla boycotts resulting in damage, attacks, vandalism or sabotage, from collusion and funding from nonprofits/NGOs or foreign sponsors, as being reported and investigated, may be illegal in states and is under federal law like 18 U.S.C. § 1361.  Take it to the comments.

For clarification, a "collusive boycott" refers to a situation where multiple businesses, often competitors, intentionally coordinate to refuse to do business and may be illegal.

NNN - While boycotts in general are legal if done properly, the boycott being targeted at Elon/Tesla is breaking multiple laws. Making this an illegal boycott. For example, destruction of property, violent threats, blatant lies, collusion, violating anti trust laws, etc.

Trump expressed his personal support for Elon by buying a Tesla in personal defiance of a boycott and Elon thanked him. That’s it.

CNs seem to be hallucinating that they said something else, but they didn’t.

NNN - Destruction of property is not a form of 'peaceful protest,' and is in fact the illegal behavior that OP is referring to.
