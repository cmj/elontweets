False.
The claim that “Democrats want to allow illegal immigrants to vote” is a common Republican talking point, but it is not supported by evidence. Non-citizens, including undocumented immigrants, are prohibited by federal law from voting in U.S. federal elections.

NNN - "Democrats want illegals to vote" is an opinion. 
We don't CN opinions. In fact it's one of the reasons why a note might be marked as misleading. 
Cool Star Bluejay, have you read the CN guidelines? There is some crazy stuff in there!
