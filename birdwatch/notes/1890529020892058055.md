NNN - Take your grievances to the comments. Vance isn't in charge of who enters the oval office and the AP removal by Trump has nothing to do with this speech. Grow up.

JD Vance defends free speech as AP is kicked out of the White House for calling the Gulf of Mexico by its name.

He lectures Europe on democracy while being the ‚Äúvice‚Äù of a President who attempted a coup.
