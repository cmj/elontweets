NNN   

CN actually supports the post's claim as François Bayrou was not convicted for the same offense. There is the appearance of a double standard.

The same law convicted Centrist Party politicians last year, hard to argue that its unevenly applied.

If a European political party misuses EU funds it is in violation of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1141/20

This regulation is imposed directly without a legal mechanism to override

The French justice system has no recourse for action
It is the responsibility of the APPF

Marine Le Pen was found guilty of public embezzlement with €4M for her party the National Front. The French law, voted by the democratically elected parliament, automatically makes elected officials convicted of embezzlement of public funds ineligible.

The original post fails to mention the circumstances behind Marine Le Pen’s conviction. Also fails to mention that she has run and failed in previous election cycles directly contradicts the post.

Marine Le Pen has already run in 3 French presidential elections in the past (2012, 2017, 2022) & has failed each time. Also, the parties from which the current French President Macron & his Prime Minister Bayrou, come are not from the Radical Left but from the Center-Right

The court estimated that Le Pen had embezzled €4 million over 12 years, €474,000 of which Le Pen was held personally responsible for as an MEP. The trial went through 5 different courts, 3 french, 2 europeans. Le Pen herself supported the ban to run for life in such cases.

to all smartass CN who clearly have a superficial knowledge of the case: please educate yourselves on (1) why Le Pen is still considered innocent as she will file many appeals (2) why the judges' PREEMPTIVE barring from election is contrary to the French law and jurisprudence

A verdade é que a esquerda não admite perder. Sendo assim, procuram de todas as formas confiscar o direito de seus opositores.
Assim tem sido sempre.
