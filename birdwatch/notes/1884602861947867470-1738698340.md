There is no legal authority to permit the federal government to pay employees not to work for this length of time. Per 5 USC 6329a, only ten days of paid administrative leave are allowed per year. By law, actual buyouts (VSIP) are capped at $25k.

Not all resignees can "do what they want", some will work their way out from home

Agreement states "I will assist my agency... to facilitate my departure" 

"my agency will likely make adjustments... reducing my official duties, and/or placing me on paid administrative leave"

Surowieki’s statement is correct. The official OPM memo only states that paid administrative leave is an option, and is not guaranteed. “ my employing agency will likely make adjustments … including … reducing my official duties, and/or placing me on paid administrative leave.” https://www.opm.gov/fork
