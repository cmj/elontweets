Our Public Service usually plays down facts with their own explanations 
And facts isnt their goal 
So the statistics is correct as they are presented

For context: most of those 183 people came to Sweden in the 1970's - 1990's for 3 distinct reasons. 

1. Chilean Refugees (1973 - 1979)
2. Collapse of the Soviet Union c. 1991
3. War in Yugoslavia (1991 - 2001)

Many decades later felt safe to return to visit.

The survey asked people who immigrated to Sweden for various reasons, often decades ago.
18% of them came to Sweden on refugee status, with 4% arriving between 2010-2022.
79% of these 18% later vacationed in their land of origin,  situation may have improved since leaving.

The people asked in this survey have mostly lived in Sweden for many years and are not at all representative for the group "refugees". The people behind the survey have also explained this: https://novus.se/nyheter/2024/12/fortydligande-av-resultatet-fran-en-av-vara-undersokningar-dar-malgruppen-ar-fodda-utomlands/

The survey asked people Born overseas the reason they came to Sweden. It doesn’t ask about their current migration status.
It’s worth noting that Sweden took hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Chilean dictatorship, the Yugoslav wars, the USSR, and the Iraq-Iran war.
