Mr. Musk is referring to arrests of those on the list; not the arrests of Epstein & Maxwell.  He probably could stand to redo the post to say no one else has been arrested.

This post is outdated and missing context as Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested and also sentenced to 20 years in prison for conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein. The counter should currently be at least 0001.

Ghislaine Maxwell does not fit the definition of pedophile in this context. Her role was very different. 

 None of the men publicly listed in the Epstein files have had charges brought.

Jeffery Epistein  was indeed arrested.
