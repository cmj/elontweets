[Mon Feb 10, 2025 17:32:04 UTC] @elonmusk (Harry Bōlz)【𝗕】: Under Biden, FEMA betrayed the American people by diverting funds meant for natural disasters to pay for luxury hotels for illegal migrants [@robbystarbuck] The FEMA situation is MUCH worse than them spending $59M on illegals as our citizens still suffer after natural disasters. Per the great work of @BreannaMorello, we know FEMA spent hundreds of millions on illegals over the past 4 years and that’s only ONE agency. Total betrayal. https://t.co/0oPoHsBg8B | ↳ 4,933 ⇅ 38,492 ♥ 125,535 🡕 8,598,283 | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1889004418642624866

NNN - You are proving his claim by saying FEMA funds (that are used to provide aid for disasters) were used for illegal migrant housing.

Musk expresses his opinion. Proposed additional context confuses rather than brings clarity; nor does it support or contradict the post. No note needed.

The SSP, as directed by Congress, is administered by FEMA in partnership with US Customs and Border Protection to provide sheltering and related activities to noncitizen migrants following their release from the DHS. This is separate and distinct from disaster relief funds. https://www.fema.gov/grants/shelter-services-program
