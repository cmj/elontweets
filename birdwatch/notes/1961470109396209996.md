Research from multiple studies (e.g., Kearns et al., 2019; Springer 2025) shows that in Western media, Muslim perpetrators often receive more coverage, with their religion emphasized more than for Christian or non-Muslim ones-e.g., 357% more attention for terrorist acts.

Grok isn’t a reliable source

Study referenced has serious & discrediting issues: 
- a timeframe that excludes 9/11, Boston Bombing, Pulse Shooting 
- disputed definitions of terrorism
- limited media evaluation
Furthermore- it’s true Arab names sometimes not printed in UK papers
