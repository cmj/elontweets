The rule is that candidates who are the nominee of multiple parties appear on the ballot as the nominee for each party. The public endorses which parties are recognized as official by voting , which determines which party appears at the top of the ballot.

Mamdani and Sliwa are on the ballot twice because both received endorsements from two parties.

Andrew Cuomo appears where independent candidates usually appear.

Many errors in this post:
- misrepresenting no ID as a scam (legal for registered voters, affidavit for others).
- calling multiple candidate listings a flaw (it's legal fusion voting).
- suggesting Cuomo's placement is unfair (standard for independents).

New York allows nominations by multiple parties. Mamdani (D)  and Sliva (R) both have two lines while Cuomo as an independent is in the normal place for independent candidates. This is normal and there is no evidence of a “scam”. The NYC Board of Elections is a bipartisan body.

NN, OP suggests the ballot is meant to disfavor Cuomo, which is false. 

In NY, candidates can run on multiple parties’ lines, so one person may be listed multiple times. The major parties are listed first, followed by smaller parties; “Fight and Deliver” isn’t a major party.

Elon doesn't understand this simple ballot. Mamdani and Sliwa appear twice because two separate parties endorsed them. Cuomo appears on one line because he is running INDEPENDENT.

New York State has fusion voting which allows candidates to be backed by multiple parties on the ballot. Cuomo has appeared on multiple ballot lines in the past when he was the candidate for multiple parties. He has one line now because he is the candidate for 0 parties.

Elon expresses a personal opinion about the structure of the ballot listing candidates multipletimes. Most states do not allow fusion voting. 

Elon is correct Voter ID is not required to vote in New York, as even first time voters can vote by affidavit ballots without ID.

NNN-OP doesnt need to be called names for expressing a well-balanced opinion 1st & then follows that opinion w defined, objective, and clear bullet points citing the redundancies (for possible misleading double counting) and locations of candidates could bias leading confusion.
