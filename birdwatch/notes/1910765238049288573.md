Evidence emerged in 2014 that the U.S. has been functioning more like an oligarchy than a representative democracy since the 1980s.

comical cave toucan & expressive pecan crimsonwing have community noted this post when there is nothing to add to. They are videos of Sanders over many years stating that the "USA is headed towards oligarchy" repeated ad nauseam.

NNN: to comical cave toucan. Bernie says "This country is hurdling rapidly towards oligarchy" He doesn't say it currently functions as an oligarchy...and who knows more than him considering he's been saying that for the past 32 years. lol

NNN. Proposed note by Expressive Pecan Crimsonwing speculates as if OP is trying to misdefine the word "Oligarchy", when it’s simply reflecting on Senator Sanders’ stance on the United States’ growing economic inequality. Speculations and  opinions should stay in comments.
