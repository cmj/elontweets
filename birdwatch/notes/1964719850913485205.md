Over 90% of proposed notes never become visible and the ones that do often appear well after the false information has already been seen by vastly more people.

The consensus algorithm often hides notes that would benefit a side in partisan debates, regardless of the accuracy.

Elon Musk virtually never gets community noted, dispite regulary spreading misinformation.

This was the case especially during the 2024 US election.

While true, you still need other community noters to agree before it is added. So your note could be true, but if others decided not to support it, no one will ever know.

You do not hear all sides of an argument. An algorithm decides who's argument to amplify and who's to silence based on on money paid to X and rules which were once open but no longer.

Algorithm last publish July 2023 despite many changes since: https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm/commits/main/

Not completely true, in Türkiye, there are hundreds of withheld (banned) accounts because they criticised Erdogan and his government. Even the main opposition rival's (Imamoglu) account is still withheld in TR.

Community notes have no fact checking mechanism and require only a consensus. 

Grok, like all LLMs, is susceptible to hallucinations and errors generated by its coding.

I believe that X should operate above governments, giving people access to information, freedom of speech and expression beyond the repression that some governments are prone to doing! Let us be factual here Mr. Musk.

It is fundamental "the people decide the narrative", because even on X, one can meet political manipulations.

I cannot provide source, because it was manipulation.

NNN. Governments requiring accounts to be withheld does not make the post untrue, nor is it a reason for a note. They cannot control local censorship laws.

Post is true in the sense that all accounts can be community noted.
