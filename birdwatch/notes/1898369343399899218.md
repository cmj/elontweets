There was no investigation. The groups organizing the protests have publicly announced who they are, when the protests were occurring, and have provided the ability for anyone to find a local protest.

The post by Mr. Musk was intended to create drama and a "secret" narrative.

ActBlue is a payment processor that disburses donations based on where each donor contributes. If a donor wants to support a political cause through ActBlue, their funds will go to only that committee. All donations to a federal PAC are listed on the FEC website.

Herbert Sandler died in 2019, making it impossible for him to fund a protest which is taking place in 2025.

Who the founders are and the fact that Actblue is founding the protests are two separate factual statements. No one said or would assume he‚Äôs personally funding it
