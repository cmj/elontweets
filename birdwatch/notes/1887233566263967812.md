Just a few days ago, the FAA‚Äôs primary aircraft safety notification system failed for several hours! https://t.co/WHwNNBN0Zd [@SecDuffy] Big News - Talked to the DOGE team. They are going to plug in to help upgrade our aviation system. | ‚Ü≥ 6,029 ‚áÖ 23,483 ‚ô• 131,609 ü°ï 17,246,919 | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1887233566263967812

NNN - CN is incorrect. High availability architectures are supposed to cover failures for a short period of time (RTO), not for a long period. Long periods increases the overall risk, even more a system that is considered critical because it deals with human lives.

While some will try to say the redundancy built into the system makes it all just fine that the primary system failed, that is not the case. The primary system is antiquated.  Even CNN wrote about it in 2023! https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/01/13/business/airline-meltdowns

Of course a note is needed. That the system had a backup is important context.

NNN The post in question specifically says the "primary aircraft safety notification system failed." The proposed note is argumentative and failed to see that the original post was correct.

the system is built around redundancy and continued to work as only the primary system "failed". the secondary system continued to operate as intended,  as noted in the tweet included in the post.
