This is a misleading video montage.
She responds to mocking and racist comments on social media targeted at her.
She invites her harassers to move to another municipality in Brussels, not another country.
On the spot, everyone agrees.

She was talking about social media posts saying she wore a curtain on her head and said if those people didn't want to see that and found Molenbeek so "unlivable" there were other municipalities in Brussels and they should get out.

No mention of Islam, Europe or Belgium.

She is never talking about the country (Belgium) but the locality. She says there are 19 localities in Brussels, people who don’t like to see ‘them’ can leave. 

‘la Région compte 19 communes. Si à Molenbeek c’est si invivable, alors changez de bord, allez ailleurs’

Elon is partially correct
She invited citizens to move to other municipalities if their opinion is against the djihab using the expression of that opinion made by 2 people who did it in a racist way.
Basically, you can move if you do not agree, not if you express it with insults.
