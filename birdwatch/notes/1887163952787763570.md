NNN I‚Äôm guessing that the CN writers didn‚Äôt look up what VOX POPULI VOX DEI actually is. The suggested CNs have zero to do with the post. Stop abusing CN.

To decide on internal matters, The U.S constitution limits voting rights to U.S citizens only. 

People who voted in this poll are citizens of countries all around the world and not just the U.S.

America has 265 millions voting-eligible population.

A poll with 1 million votes is not representative of "populi".

Moreover:
‚ÄúNec audiendi qui solent dicere vox populi vox Dei, quum tumultuositas vulgi semper insaniae proxima sit‚Äù
