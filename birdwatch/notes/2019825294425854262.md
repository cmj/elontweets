Voter fraud in U.S. elections is extremely rare, with documented cases at rates of ~0.0001% or less per multiple studies. No evidence shows it has altered federal election outcomes. 

Voter ID laws can suppress turnout among eligible voters with research estimating 1–3%.

Someone writing CNs has it in for Elon, it seems like every time he posts something there’s a Community Note…this isn’t even his post, he’s merely retweeting in agreement - that person needs to take their gripe to the original post or comments.

NNN, Elon is expressing his opinion, community notes should not be used to argue about what people are really thinking in their deepest, darkest thoughts.
