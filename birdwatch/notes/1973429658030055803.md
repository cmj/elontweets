The ADL however WAS delivering civil rights and “hate crime” training for both the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. Perpetuating their bias as expertise https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/speeches/the-fbi-and-the-adl-working-toward-a-world-without-hate

The FBI doesn’t use ADL “hate group” lists as law. While ADL reports exist, FBI investigations require evidence of crimes or threats. Turning Point was probed for election issues, not ADL labels. And Kirk’s murder is being investigated—claim is false & misleading.

Re initial CN: The post’s author is clearly stating the FBI uses ADL’s “definitions” not “lists”. Read and comprehend first. Quit using CN be argumentative and factually incorrect.
