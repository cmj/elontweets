Almost none of the claims in this post are accurate. McGregor hasn’t been blocked from standing and nor is he a frontrunner nor is there any significant public support for him.

This is misrepresentation Ireland’s President is elected by public vote. Candidates need 20 Oireachtas members or 4 local councils to nominate them. Party leaders can direct their own party councillors, but they cannot block independents from seeking nomination. https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article12

Google searches for James Brennan do not reveal the article which does not appear to exist.  

Polls indicate Heather Humphreys is leading followed by Connolly/ Galvin not McGregor.
