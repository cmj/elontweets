Ursula von der Leyen is not the leader of the EU. She is head of the Commission, the effective civil service of the EU. The EU's leadership is vested in the European Parliament and the Council which is made up of the leaders of the constituent member states of the EU.

Direct election of the Head of Government is not a prerequisite for Democracy. In fact, in most democracies it is derived from and selected by the (elected) Parliaments, not by voters.

Even in the United States, President is elected indirectly via the Electoral College.

Democracy definition is broad and does not imply that leaders must be directly elected: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy

For example, in the USA the president is not elected directly: people elect representatives (the Electoral College) who elect the president. Outcome sometimes differs from direct votes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election

The CNs calling USA a democracy and referencing the Electoral College are in incorrect. The USA is more accurately described as a Constitutional Federal Republic https://ar.usembassy.gov/u-s-government/
