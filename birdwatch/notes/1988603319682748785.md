EU Commission President nominated by qualified majority in European Council (EU heads of state/gov't) & elected by majority in European Parliament. Von der Leyen won 383 votes this way in July 2019. Musk's comment sparks democratic legitimacy debate.

Ursula von der Leyen is not the leader of the EU. She is head of the Commission, the effective civil service of the EU. The EU's leadership is vested in the European Parliament and the Council which is made up of the leaders of the constituent member states of the EU.

Direct election of the Head of Government is not a prerequisite for Democracy. In fact, in most democracies it is derived from and selected by the (elected) Parliaments, not by voters.

Even in the United States, President is elected indirectly via the Electoral College.

Democracy definition is broad and does not imply that leaders must be directly elected: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy

For example, in the USA the president is not elected directly: people elect representatives (the Electoral College) who elect the president. Outcome sometimes differs from direct votes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election

Even though technically she is not the leader of EU, Ursula von der Leyen is the president of the European commission which de facto gives her the right of initiative on union legislation. She should be elected or her powers should be curtailed.

chipper avocado treerunner - That may have been true when Senators were appointed by state Governors and the House of Representatives picked the President but they are now democratically elected so the US is a democracy. X.Com

The CNs calling USA a democracy and referencing the Electoral College are in incorrect. The USA is more accurately described as a Constitutional Federal Republic https://ar.usembassy.gov/u-s-government/
