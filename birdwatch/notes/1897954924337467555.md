This lad is spreading disinformation(inserts Jerry meme) He wants to be an exception to government regulations, sadly, he has to abide by the regulations like everyone. Starlink is free to operate in South Africa. Adidas is allowed to operate in South Africa, it‚Äôs white owned

Starlink is allowed to operate in South Africa as long as it agrees to the 30% local ownership policy, which applies to all foreign companies that want to conduct business in South Africa.

Starlink cannot operate in South Africa due to a regulatory requirement that telecom companies must have 30% ownership by "historically disadvantaged groups" (HDGs), part of the country‚Äôs Black Economic Empowerment policy.

Elon's claim is not factually true. His company refuses to comply to local laws of economic inclusion for once marginalised races.

Elon musk is correct. Broad based black economic empowerment does not apply to black individuals in South Africa, only white individuals to "redress past injustices". Ultimately it is a race based laws in favour of benefiting the black south Africans.

The proposed CNs actually 100% confirm that Elon's post is factually correct.
If he was black, Starlink would be allowed to operate.
Starlink is not allowed to operate, because it's not black owned.

It's a fact based on the proposed notes that if Elon was black, he would be able to operate in South Africa. Post is factually correct. Stop defending racism.

Elon was born in South Africa (SA), if he was black he would qualify as previously disadvantaged in SA and the requirement to be 30% owned by previously disadvantaged groups would be fulfilled, and thus Elon is correct. Broad based black economic empowerment laws obstruct.

NNN- Elon is correct. SA requires 30 per cent of the equity in the project to black-owned businesses.

He owns 40% of SpaceX, which owns Starlink.

Therefore, if he was black, it would move forward without an issue.
