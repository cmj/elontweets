Starlink cannot operate in South Africa due to a regulatory requirement that telecom companies must have 30% ownership by "historically disadvantaged groups" (HDGs), part of the country‚Äôs Black Economic Empowerment policy.

NNN- Elon is correct. SA requires 30 per cent of the equity in the project to black-owned businesses.

He owns 40% of SpaceX, which owns Starlink.

Therefore, if he was black, it would move forward without an issue.
