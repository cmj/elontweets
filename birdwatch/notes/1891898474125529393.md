1. Statement of opinion about merits
2. Underlying facts are true 
3. Proposed CN about court challenges are irrelevant. Broader point is about the deliberate effort to grant voting to any non-citizens for any election

As of November 2024, D.C. and municipalities in CA, MD, and VT allowed noncitizens to vote in local elections.

In 2022, NYC voted to allow noncitizens to vote, but a court case that found the law unconstitutional is under appeal.

NNN. Current proposed note misses key points of post and cherry picks a single situation to make a counter argument.

In 2022 New York a law was introduced that would give non-citizens the right to vote in local elections. This law was never implemented due to a legal challenge, so non-citizens can't not vote.

The New York supreme court have yet to decide to reinstate the law.
