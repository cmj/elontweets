While human expeditions to Mars as soon as 2029 sounds exciting, unfortunately Elon Musk has a well documented history of over promising and under delivering. He has previously stated in 2011 that "We can put a man on Mars in 10 years."

NNN. Musk is well known to be aggressive with timelines, and often, but not always, misses them. This means that we have no way of knowing if he is correct, and it is obviously just his opinion.
