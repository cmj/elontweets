"Data suggests right-wing extremists commit more political violence in the US than left-wing groups. ADL reports ~75% of extremist murders over the past decade (~338 of 450) were by right-wing actors, vs ~4% (~18) by left-wing."

Vance Boelter, an evangelical christian, had the names of far left politicians on his hit list, including Ilhan Omar. There is far more evidence that he is a right winger. https://abcnews.go.com/US/2-minnesota-lawmakers-shot-targeted-incident-officials/story?id=122840751

There’s no proof that the person or persons responsible for the attacks is a part of the “far left”. To assume so this early is a gross misrepresentation of the facts of the case.
