Zero evidence to suggest Boetler was left-leaning. 
Regarding his appointment by Governor Walz: “The Governor’s Office appoints thousands of these people from all parties to these boards and commissions”

Dozens of Democrats and Abortion providers were on Boetler’s hit list.

✅Fact: politically-motivated shooting occurred.

❌Unsubstantiated: OP’s claims about “left” committing widespread violence.

⚠️Misleading generalization: Musk’s response amplifies false equivalency (brand entire political group as "murderously violent" based on one’s actions).

"Data suggests right-wing extremists commit more political violence in the US than left-wing groups. ADL reports ~75% of extremist murders over the past decade (~338 of 450) were by right-wing actors, vs ~4% (~18) by left-wing."

The suspect in question killed a Democratic state representative and injured another Democrat, as well as had abortion providers on their hit list in the manifesto. There is no proof that they are “far left”.

Vance Boelter, an evangelical christian, had the names of far left politicians on his hit list, including Ilhan Omar. There is far more evidence that he is a right winger. https://abcnews.go.com/US/2-minnesota-lawmakers-shot-targeted-incident-officials/story?id=122840751

There’s no proof that the person or persons responsible for the attacks is a part of the “far left”. To assume so this early is a gross misrepresentation of the facts of the case.
