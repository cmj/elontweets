[Mon Feb 17, 2025 18:30:47 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: Who is confirming that gold wasn’t stolen from Fort Knox?  Maybe it’s there, maybe it’s not.  That gold is owned by the American public! We want to know if it’s still there. [@BasedMikeLee] As a U.S. senator I’ve tried repeatedly to get into Fort Knox  Fort Knox: “You can’t come to Fort Knox.” Me: “Why?” Fort Knox: “It’s a military installation.” Me: “I’m a senator; I go to military bases all the time.” Fort Knox: “You still can’t come. Because, you can’t.” | ↳ 13,429 ⇅ 36,835 ♥ 202,122 🡕 30,591,069 | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1891555910218097122

gold is a valuable physical monetary asset and in present times is a hedge against inflation, due to current demand & surge in gold prices it is relevant the new govt is trying to make sure about the total value of gold and to avoid a situation of mistrust like in the UK LBMA

NNN - Elon is clearly asking a question whether it's there or not.  And someone who is clearly auditing our government must inspect it.

NNN: There hasn't been a full audit since 1953, the others were just a peek in. The other note is based upon information that can not be verified till an audit has happened and till then is just speculation. The OP voices an opinion. Take the argument to the comment section.
