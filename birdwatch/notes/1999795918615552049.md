This is not true. 
People with Swyer Syndrom have a womb and XY chromosomes.

“Grok, is Elon right?.“ 

“No. Biological sex is primarily defined by gametes, not organs like the uterus. In evolutionary biology and reproductive science, females are organisms that produce large gametes (ova/eggs), while males produce small gametes (sperm).”

In medicine sex is defined by a set of traits (chromosomes, gonads, hormones, anatomy). A hysterectomy – the removal of uterus – does not alter sex, while intersex conditions have variability of chromosomal, hormonal, and anatomical combinations.

>If you have a womb, you are a woman.
Womb is a reproductive organ for bearing offspring found only in females. Women are adult human females, this claim is correct.
>Otherwise, you are not.
Women who had a hysterectomy or have MRKH syndrome are also females, so it's incorrect.

Some women are born without a womb (uterus) due to a condition called Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, which affects about 1 in 5,000 females.

It isn’t difficult. Human females have chromosomes that make them female. Chromosomes, two different kinds: X and Y, which determine biologically male (XY) or female (XX).

Yes, if we interpret Elon Musk's statement—"If you have a womb, you are a woman. Otherwise, you are not."—as referring to the original, congenital (as-born) condition rather than current anatomy after medical interventions, then it holds true for well over 99% of cases.

It is, and has always been, factual to say that women have a womb. The obvious intent of the poster (based on his well known opinions and previous commentary on the issue) was not to imply that women with hysterectomies are no longer women, but that men will never be women.

NNN-  while it's correct that having a hysterectomy doesn't turn a woman into a man.

The fact remains that only women can have their wombs removed.

Men don't have them, and this note belongs in the comments.

A dog is a carnivorous animal with four legs, a tail, descendant of wolfs.

Loosing the tail does not change this anymore than removing the womb changes the sex/gender of a woman (or a female dog).
