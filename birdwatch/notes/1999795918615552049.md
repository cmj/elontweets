The statement is partially true. All humans who have a womb are in fact female. 

However, there are rare instances where females can be born without wombs, or lose their wombs.

Any community note arguing that trans women are females without wombs is factually incorrect.

“Grok, is Elon right?.“ 

“No. Biological sex is primarily defined by gametes, not organs like the uterus. In evolutionary biology and reproductive science, females are organisms that produce large gametes (ova/eggs), while males produce small gametes (sperm).”

In medicine sex is defined by a set of traits (chromosomes, gonads, hormones, anatomy). A hysterectomy – the removal of uterus – does not alter sex, while intersex conditions have variability of chromosomal, hormonal, and anatomical combinations.

>If you have a womb, you are a woman.
Womb is a reproductive organ for bearing offspring found only in females. Women are adult human females, this claim is correct.
>Otherwise, you are not.
Women who had a hysterectomy or have MRKH syndrome are also females, so it's incorrect.

Of all the proposed community notes the one which explained sex is defined by gametes is the only correct one, but in humans a womb is in females. All other are just abnormal pathology or just surgery in females. Thus, all these notes should be in comments to allow rebuttals.

Yes, if we interpret Elon Musk's statement—"If you have a womb, you are a woman. Otherwise, you are not."—as referring to the original, congenital (as-born) condition rather than current anatomy after medical interventions, then it holds true for well over 99% of cases.

It is, and has always been, factual to say that women have a womb. The obvious intent of the poster (based on his well known opinions and previous commentary on the issue) was not to imply that women with hysterectomies are no longer women, but that men will never be women.

NNN-  while it's correct that having a hysterectomy doesn't turn a woman into a man.

The fact remains that only women can have their wombs removed.

Men don't have them, and this note belongs in the comments.

A dog is a carnivorous animal with four legs, a tail, descendant of wolfs.

Loosing the tail does not change this anymore than removing the womb changes the sex/gender of a woman (or a female dog).
