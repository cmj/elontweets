Tesla's owners manual specifically states:

"Warning
Never leave a child unattended in your vehicle."
Also, "Never rely on your vehicle to protect something irreplaceable."

This is found in the section "Keep Climate On, Dog, and Camp".

Don’t mix Cabin Overhead Protection with Dog Mode. These are two completely different functions of the vehicle.

Cabin Overheat Protection and Dog Mode work the same way and do the same thing... they use the Tesla's heatpump to cool the interior of the car, in order to protect its contents. 

The only difference between the two is the use of slightly different parameters in software.

NNN. Good point but it belongs in comments.

NNN - Dog Mode in it of itself is essentially Cabin Overheat Protection, just more active and aware because there is a living being within the vehicle.
