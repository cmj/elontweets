@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: Why is “white” always in lowercase, but Black is uppercase, @nytimes? The NY Times is deliberate, precise and comprehensive in its anti-White racism. | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1965549911325425716

The NYT Style guidelines contain ideological biases. Although trying to be perceived as objective, research indicates that it does choose to lean left or progressive in its language choices and editorial style.

There is simply no reason black should be capitalized and white should be lowercase, it is acceptable racism by the AP, regardless of style.

The New York Times follows AP style, which capitalizes the B in Black but not the W in white. Other media outlets, including Fox News, follow the same practice.

Scholarly Blue Swan, Fox isn't following NYT nor AP. 

Your link to FOX clearly states Black will be capitalized & other colors used to describe race, such as White & Brown, will also will be capitalized. Including Asian, African American, Latino, Hispanic and Native American.

The New York Times does not use AP style, it uses its own style guide.

nnn, the fact that others are also racist does not make the action any less racist.

Also, the NYT deliberately altered Dinesha's quote, changing 'black' to 'Black'.
