NNN. Post is not specifying the source of funds, just the amount. The Ukraine has indeed received the equivalent of hundreds of billions of dollars in aid.

This is exactly why an audit needs to be performed on where the money went.  Straight from the horses mouth.  
‚Äú But in reality, we received about US$76 billion. It‚Äôs significant aid, but it‚Äôs not US$200 billion."

NNN - nothing to fact check with this post.  Musk and DOGE are investigating spending from within the government to find waste and fraud.

While the US Congress appropriated $182.8 billion in the 5 bills associated with Ukraine, most of the money is not for Ukraine. 
According to the governmental sources below, the US has spent $32.6 billion in cash, plus $25.3 in old weapons (reevaluated just $18 billion).

a large percentage of the money was spent on firearms and ammunition. manufactured in the US, so there was little cash sent directly to Ukraine, the money actually helped to boost American economy. https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-political-military-affairs/releases/2025/01/u-s-security-cooperation-with-ukraine/

The GOA tracks all aid sent to Ukraine from the US, as do other governments for their spending. A full report can be found in the link
