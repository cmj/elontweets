[Tue Feb 11, 2025 09:07:44 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: This is deeply wrong! A judge just blocked dropping the overhead charged on NIH grants from the outrageous 60% to a far more reasonable 15%.  This judge is FORCING the CORRUPTION to CONTINUE.  WTF. [@kyledcheney] JUST IN: A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration's rate change to NIH grants. https://t.co/6KIVlfkz63 | ↳ 15,025 ⇅ 37,227 ♥ 143,411 🡕 14,654,573 | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1889239888546963794
