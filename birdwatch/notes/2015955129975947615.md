Misleading – X Chat offers e2e encryption but lacks forward secrecy: key compromise exposes all past messages. Private keys are controlled by X, protected only by a 4-digit PIN. Metadata is collected. Signal provides forward secrecy, device-only keys, and minimal metadata.

Beware, X's so-called end-to-end encryption is misleading. It relies on a 4-digit PIN to protect your private encryption key, which is extremely weak by cryptographic standards. The keys themselves are stored and managed by X, not exclusively on user devices.

According to the Head of WhatsApp: "WhatsApp can’t read messages because the encryption keys are stored on your phone and we don’t have access to them."

NNN. There is an ongoing lawsuit alleging Meta employees can request to view a user’s messages through a simple process, thus bypassing the app’s end-to-end encryption. 

Any reference, comparison, or mention of other encrypted messaging apps should be left in the Comments.

NNN. The shared article concerns a lawsuit specifically claiming that this statement is not true and the position of Meta is evident from the article.
