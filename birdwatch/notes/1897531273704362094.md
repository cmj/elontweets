[Thu Mar 06, 2025 06:14:44 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)„Äêùóï„Äë: They want the forever war.  How many more parents with no sons? How many more children with no fathers? By their logic, it never ends. [@WallStreetMav] European leaders are retarded. Danish PM Mette Frederiksen:  "Peace in Ukraine is more dangerous than the ongoing war."  She won't end the war because Putin might attack someone else in the future.  Under that logic, there is no end to the war ever. https://t.co/KdNzKnwIcO | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1897531273704362094

The interviewed person does not claim to want a forever war but instead, a victory in the war against aggressor because Russian media is openly telling they want a peace only to regroup and attack later on a scale twice as large.

NNN - Elon rode on the fact the PM already talked about on continuing the fight. He is simply stating his opinion that not getting a ceasefire now would mean the war continues and escalates with no end in  sight and used the forever war phrase to drive home his point.
