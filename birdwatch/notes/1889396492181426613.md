The notion of having a judge job for life, no matter how bad the judgments, is ridiculous! Enough is enough. [@SenMikeLee] These judges are waging an unprecedented assault on legitimate presidential authority, all the way down to dictating what webpages the government has.

The pages in question provide the most up to date information concerning public health. Clinicians sometime print information from CDC, NIH, and FDA to give to patients as part of care, such as vaccine safety information from CDC given to patients at time of vaccination.
