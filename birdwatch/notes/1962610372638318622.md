Note Needed
Musk’s opinion, which wouldn’t need a note by itself, also implies recency of the factual event, which is not recent.

Community notes are also used to provide context to jokes etc.Post clearly states that the situation is becoming worst every month, but using irrelevant proof. Whether this post needs context or not is an opinion, the task of community notes is to provide context when it's lacking.

NNN - The post by Elon does not mention it's current, or hint at it. It references a 2020 article, and then he states an opinion about it getting worse every month, not just every year.

This post clearly demonstrates the current scenario of Europe. By telling that this news is of 5 years old, one of the note tries to downplay an alarming issue faced most of the European nations. But using the community notes to divert from the issue is not good.

The information in the note should be on the quoted tweet and not this one.
