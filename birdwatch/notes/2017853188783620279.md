@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: @ShitpostRock Admittedly, I was at first dumb enough to think he actually meant hanging out with UN diplomats 🤣🤣 However, even after he clarified that he meant a party with young women “under age 25”, I still chose working on rockets and cars. | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/2017853188783620279

Elon still attempted to make plans to go to the island after this exchange.

NNN - In this tweet, Elon only claims he chose to work instead of going to this specific party. However the replies and community notes here try pointing out he asks to meet up at other events, which are separate and not related to this specific event in question.

Re note from “Splendid Slope Magpie“: the provided source links to a tweet to some random dude who makes a random claim. This is not a valid source. 

There’s no need for speculation on such a topic, neither deception to make a speculation look like a fact.
