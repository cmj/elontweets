Isabella I of Castile was among the earliest European monarchs to act against slavery. In 1500 she prohibited the enslavement of Indigenous peoples in the Americas, principles codified in the Laws of Burgos (1512–1513), an early legal framework recognizing native rights.

NNN. First Community Note source does not support the note's claim. The source shows that this lady of Spain and her laws put Indians into internment camps, took their land, forced religious conversion, all under threat of forced labor and financial extortion
