The post is making a statement which as yet cannot be corroborated   The unofficial inquiry associated with Rupert Lowe & therefore it is not impartial.    Evidence for the inquiry is submitted on-line & can be easily fed inaccurate information and testimony.    https://form.typeform.com/to/IbsSwuMn?typeform-source=www.therapeganginquiry.org 

#### NOT MISLEADING

NNN. Not claimed to be a gov inquiry.
It’s rich to attack the Inquiry Project for being unofficial when the UK gov itself refused to launch a formal inquiry for years, dragging its feet until June 2025. The government’s delay left a vacuum that unofficial efforts stepped into.
