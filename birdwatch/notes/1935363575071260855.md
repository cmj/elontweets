The post misses important context.

In 2016, Twitter was moved from the social media category to the news category to improve visibility.

Being fundamentally a social network with many users, X has been at the top or close to the top in the news category since then.

Note Needed: EWW - This is not an opinion. The current 'context' note is correcting misinformation from the publishers of X. Stop calling it an opinion when it is blatantly not an opinion, especially when the note is backed up by sources to disprove the claim.
