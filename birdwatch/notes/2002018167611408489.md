​UK Govt plans:

​Swift Courts: Judge-only trials for crimes with expected sentences ≤3 years.

​Exceptions: Murder, rape, GBH, and robbery remain jury trials.
​Fraud: Complex financial cases move to judge-only.

​Goal: Cut 78k case backlog; est. 20% faster than juries.

NNN. Cool Coral Turkey's proposed note may be the rummiest proposed community note I've seen after countless hours reading rummy proposed community notes. It is a complete non sequitur that doesn't even attempt to address the original post.
