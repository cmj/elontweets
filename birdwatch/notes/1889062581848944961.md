Neither the SSA nor IRS use RDBMS. They run on COBOL and use flat files on mainframes.

The post context is the social security administration which has been around before SQL for relational databases. There is no public information to say it was transferee to a RDMS as the note implies because some other newer part of government uses it.

The Social Security Administration and several other government entities utilize MySQL and thus are "using SQL"

the government does, in fact, use SQL

Numerous U.S. federal agencies use SQL for managing relational databases. For example, MySQL, open-source tool that relies on SQL, is used by numerous agencies including the Department of Defense.

The government uses NoSQL as well.

Furthermore the SSA uses IBM‚Äôs DB2
https://oig.ssa.gov/assets/uploads/a-14-09-19097summary.pdf

Which does not runs Big SQL which allows non relational objects to be accessed and would be more akin to NoSQL

NNN - Elon is technically correct as the government uses NoSQL as well.
