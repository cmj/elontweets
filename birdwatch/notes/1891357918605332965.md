The estimated number of green card recipients in the US is about 13 million.

Only a minority of these recipients would be eligible for social security payments and do not explain the large gap highlighted here.

SSA actually updates death records quickly. Benefits are canceled within the month when notified.

No note needed. His first claim is obviously true. There are far more SSN holders than US citizens. (And green cards don't explain such a big discrepancy.)

The second statement about the potential fraud is an opinion. Please discuss that in the comments.

Social security numbers are issued to non-citizens (green cards, visas), and SSA death records update slowly. A higher SSN count ‚â† fraud, just bureaucracy. Firings may worsen such delays.

Comparing the number of social security numbers to the number of citizens is pointless because many non-citizens are eligible as well and they never expire.
