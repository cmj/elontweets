Elon's bias aside, this is a historically inaccurate statement. The basis of this claim is usually tied to perception, with political affiliation of the one making the claim being inherently biased to the opposing party. Historically the right is more prone to induce violence.

The left is historically the most violent. The black panthers, the weather underground, Antifa, etc. There is no equivalent on the right.

NNN - There are no national studies of crime based on political affiliation. When applying voter demographics from exit polling, Democrat voters are twice as likely to commit a violent crime when compared to Republicans. OP's post is factually true.

NNN - People really need to stop using Community Notes as a way to potentially highlight their basic replies. Just use the comment/reply feature like everyone else does.
