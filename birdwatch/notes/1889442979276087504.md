A CEO who knowingly harms shareholder value may violate fiduciary duties, including the duty of care (informed decisions), duty of loyalty (no conflicts of interest), and duty of good faith (acting honestly). Violations can lead to lawsuits, removal, fines, or SEC penalties. https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-falls-again-and-this-analyst-says-why-its-an-elon-musk-problem-a7ac0f01
