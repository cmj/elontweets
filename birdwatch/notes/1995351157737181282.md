Claims that the Biden-Harris admin imported millions of non-citizens with voting or welfare access are false. U.S. law bars non-citizens, including parolees, from voting or most benefits. SSNs for work do not grant citizenship, voting rights, or automatic welfare eligibility.

Elon Musk continues to highlight fake news.  

You do not get access to the voting both or the ability to vote just by having a social security number. The Biden administration did not fly people in the USA and have those same people escorted in mass across the US border.

There is no evidence of significant numbers of non-citizen voting.
