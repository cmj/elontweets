@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: Suicide risk increases massively for people who undergo sex change operations. “Would you rather have a live daughter or a dead son due to suicide?” to convince parents to approve child mutilation is the most evil lie ever told. Also many deaths due to failed surgeries. | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1984294801311961178

Data comparing pre- and post op suicide in trans people show little change in risk. 
It's untrue that sex change operations massively increase risk of suicide. 
On the other hand, the live-daughter-vs-dead-son argument is also a myth encouraging unscientific gender treatments.

It is untrue that sex change operations massively increases risk risk of suicide for trans. Data comparing pre and post op trans people show little change in suicide risk. Comparing risk for transsexuals people who vs non trans people is irrelevant evidence logical fallacy https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2020.1778correction?utm_source=chatgpt.com

The SA by 24 people is related to a financial extortion group targeting a trans household in 
Nandlalpura India and not related to trans surgeries:

"Haji had been forcing trans community members into “bonded labor” for 16 years by forcing them to beg for money."

Completed suicides among trans people are elevated, but still quite rare.

Data of all transgender suicides in the Amsterdam clinic since 1972 found that 41 out of 5107 transwomen died of suicide (0.8%), and 8 out of 3156 transmen died of suicide (0.25%).

It is overgeneralized and not universally supported, as other research indicates potential benefits for some patients

Perceptive Riverbank Canary provided official data showing a seemingly marginal number of deaths. However, had it not been for the transition, most—if not all—of these young people would not have died by suicide or as a result of their transitions. Therefore, NNN.

Note might be needed, but the current note is not a good one, as it does not disprove Elon’s claim. I would leave it up to another community noter to find a reliable source disproving Elon’s claim if it is false (I have not done my research on this)
