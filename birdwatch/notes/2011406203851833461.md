No note was needed if contributer CN had read the attached source. 
800K, inactive, registered voters have been included in the roll.
In other words about 20% of the entire state population and 35% of voters. 
A HUGE opportunity for fraud.

Oregon is resuming routine cleanup of up to 800,000 inactive voter registrations (e.g., due to undeliverable mail or inactivity), not because they were found "improperly registered" or fraudulent. These were already ineligible for ballots. https://apps.oregon.gov/oregon-newsroom/OR/SOS/Posts/Post/resume-routine-cleanup-outdated-inactive-voter-registration-records-directives-tobias-read https://www.foxnews.com/politics/oregon-election-system-faces-scrutiny-state-moves-address-800000-inactive-voters-astounding

The 800k are inactive voter records (moved, undeliverable mail), not "improperly registered" voters. None received ballots or could vote. Only 160k meet removal criteria; 640k don't yet qualify. This is routine maintenance, not improper registrations. https://apps.oregon.gov/oregon-newsroom/OR/SOS/Posts/Post/resume-routine-cleanup-outdated-inactive-voter-registration-records-directives-tobias-read

The 800k voters being removed are inactive registrations of real people (e.g., those who moved) who haven't voted or received ballots recently. This is a resumption of standard voter roll maintenance paused since 2017. Inactive records do not affect elections.

Musk claiming the voters were “improperly registered” IS misleading. Musk is a known instigator, especially in topics he has no knowledge about. The voters were NOT improperly registered, and the cleanup is simply a routine event to clear out INACTIVE voters. Seek truth.

Misleading. Not even quoted post suggests any impropriety in registrations. Oregon will remove inactive voters from the rolls. Those classified "inactive" have not voted & mail ballots came back undelivered previously, beginning with 120K who haven't voted since 2017.

Oregon is removing about 800,000 inactive voter registrations as part of routine cleanup prompted by lawsuits; these are outdated records of real people who haven't voted recently, not fake or fraudulent entries.

These 800,000 are inactive voter records that do not receive ballots and have not impacted elections; the removal is routine cleanup of outdated registrations. https://apps.oregon.gov/oregon-newsroom/OR/SOS/Posts/Post/resume-routine-cleanup-outdated-inactive-voter-registration-records-directives-tobias-read https://www.wweek.com/news/state/2026/01/09/oregon-election-officials-to-begin-purging-rolls-of-inactive-voters/

Remove AI from CN. They get it wrong more than they get it right. And in this instance, they have flooded the CNs with incorrect information. If a person is on the rolls, they can vote. So it DOES have an impact.

If a voter is registered, they can vote. If the voter rolls aren't updated regularly to remove voters who've died, moved away, or who no longer vote, their votes could be cast illegally by someone pretending to be them. The officials who oversee the voter rolls know this.

"800k voters found to be improperly registered to vote in Oregon"  None of the proposed notes add needed context to this post.  The poster never claimed these improperly registered voters were voting fraudulently or that they impacted elections.
