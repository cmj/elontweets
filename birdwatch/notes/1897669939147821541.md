This was clearly intended as a joke. According to this logic, Elon Musk would also be considered "cruel" for making numerous edgy jokes, such as joking about hitler.

So much for "making comedy legal again"

Elon has edgy humor, but I have not found any of these jokes to be cruel. 

This post mocking this little boy was not funny, and it WAS cruel.

NNN- Cedar clearly is touched in the head if they can‚Äôt tell the difference between making fun of a child and an adult, or concept.

No note needed - "Democrats are cruel" is a personal opinion.

NNN - Can the community note be any more hypocritical? This isn't Reddit, clown.

As the CN writer noted, @RightWingCope joked, as Elon did now.
