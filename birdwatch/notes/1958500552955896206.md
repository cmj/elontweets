@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: AI is obviously gonna one-shot the human limbic system. That said, I predict – counter-intuitively – that it will *increase* the birth rate! Mark my words.

Elon created an AI bot named Ani, and he has posted a video of her in lingerie.

Ani obviously did one-shot Elon's limbic system. However, she will not increase the birth rate.
