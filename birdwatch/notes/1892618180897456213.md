He’s a passenger. | ↳ 430 ⇅ 343 ♥ 3,268 🡕 272,637 | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1892618180897456213

NNN Dragon is fully autonomous so being a “pilot” isn’t very meaningful

The blog post cited in the proposed note lists Jasmin Moghbeli as commander, not Andreas Mogensen.

During Expedition 70, the first Dane ESA astronaut, Andreas Enevold Mogensen (Andy), was in fact the commander.

By putting on quotes the word "'Commander'", the OP implies that he never was and that is a factual error and it is misrepresentation.

ISS Commander @Astro_Andreas was literally the pilot of @SpaceX Crew-7
ISS Commander: https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Andreas_Mogensen_International_Space_Station_commander
Crew-7 Pilot: https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2023/08/24/nasas-spacex-crew-7-go-for-launch-to-space-station/

Pilots and crew by definition are not passengers.
