The blog post cited in the proposed note lists Jasmin Moghbeli as commander, not Andreas Mogensen.

NNN. Disagreements of opinion belong in the replies.

During Expedition 70, the first Dane ESA astronaut, Andreas Enevold Mogensen (Andy), was in fact the commander.

By putting on quotes the word "'Commander'", the OP implies that he never was and that is a factual error and it is misrepresentation.

Andreas Mogensen, doctor of Aerospace Engineering, was commander[1] of the ISS for 191 days during expedition 70, and pilot[1] of SpaceX Crew-7. 

Putting commander in quotes is simply factually incorrect, and as calling Elon Musk "CEO" or Donald Trump "President".

ISS Commander @Astro_Andreas was literally the pilot of @SpaceX Crew-7

Crew-7 Pilot: https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2023/08/24/nasas-spacex-crew-7-go-for-launch-to-space-station/

Pilots and crew by definition are not passengers.
