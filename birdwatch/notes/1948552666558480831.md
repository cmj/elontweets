While it’s true the most of the energy hitting the earth is solar, most of that is not usable  (sea, mountains) with current technology. Nuclear provides abundant and usable energy that could power the earth for thousands of years. It’s not solar derived and not crumbs.

NNN. The post is not misleading. The proposed note is completely pedantic. Matter, including nuclear matter, comes from stars.
