[Fri Feb 21, 2025 17:22:23 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)„Äêùóï„Äë: Russia went too far 3 years ago, now the Ukrainian government has gone too far.  Endless death in trenches is wrong and anyone who continues to push that lacks both empathy and a brain. [@AlexandruC4] Wtf happened to him in the last 3 years? https://t.co/hGi9FBUVkb | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1892988248936374711

NNN. It‚Äôs seriously time to remove CN contributors who flood every comment with their own personal opinions on a matter. That‚Äôs not what CN is for.

Ukraine is defending its own territory which is the most heroic thing anyone can do. Claiming that going too far is beyond wrong.

His opinion, but it sets up a false dichotomy.

The dichotomy:  Either you are for an enforced peace settlement benefitting  RU, or you want to see Ukrainians die"

The misinfo:  UA is cannot win. RU is inexhaustible. Capitulation is peace and preferable to fighting.

Elon Musk left South Africa before he served his mandated military service. As a result he has never served in armed conflict and possesses little to no knowledge of trench warfare. Therefore his tweets regarding wartime strategy should never be taken seriously.
