NNN - I do not support Elon and his stance on AfD, but he's expressing an opinion.

Speculation: Noting this tweet expressing his support for AfD will only reinforce Elon's beliefs that state sponsored actors are manipulating Community Notes.

NNN, Community note above not needed,
the opinion in the community note can be expressed as a comment,
notes are for correcting a post when it's misleading, and not factual, or to add important context.

Elon interest in AfD may be just related with Tesla having the key European factory in Germany, also for X stuff.
