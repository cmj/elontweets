OP's requesting AT controllers who left in the previous admin to reapply. The CN provides an LLM AI analysis of DOGE recommendations, which do not include the firing of actual AT controllers. It falsely states that OP was at fault for a shortage of air traffic controllers.

Let me repeat that no one/someone shouldn't be treated on social media having personal problems with him/her for it's counterproductive & clearly shows a kinda bias & negative behavior, please keep it to the comments if the post's claim is not false.

STOP abusing Community Notes just because you don't like someone! Take it to the comments! Nothing Elon said was incorrect, or required context. There IS a national shortage of air traffic controllers, and there IS an official FAA process for rehire of retired ATC's.

There is no need for a community note. This is a waste of time. Leave Elon in peace, he said nothing wrong and posted a message of public interest.

Note not necessarily needed.  Elon Musk says nothing specifically about rehiring past the age cap. 

In addition there are discussions about changing the age cap and this could be used to aid that push.

NNN, proposed note is incorrect. The mandated retirement rule allows exemptions ‚Äúexempt a controller having exceptional skills & experience as a controller from the automatic separation provisions of this subsection until that controller becomes 61 years of age.‚Äù

NNN community noter is assuming ATC's all retire at the mandatory age.

NNN. It's factually correct that there is a need for qualified ATCs.  OP expresses that and invites those eligible to return to consider doing so.  Comments on that belong in comments.

while Elon Musk did not directly fire air traffic controllers, his oversight of DOGE‚Äôs firings of FAA support staff likely contributes to the shortage of top notch air traffic controllers by straining the systems they depend on

To the original note poster:
February 2025, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has offered to allow controllers to stay on past age 56.
