NNN - Post is a personal opinion, figure of speech. It is not about who started the war, but who may have an opportunity to finish it and make peace.

NNN - To stop a war one side has to surrender, while Putin indeed is the agressor, Zelensky can negociate a ceasefire if he want to. What will be lost to Russia is to put in balance with what has been lost every day for the past 3 years

In fact, nobody offered Zelensky to stop the tram. What was offered was to stop resisting the tram from killing people (and agree to pay for this with the country's mineral resources), which would ultimately lead to more victims.

That is a Russian trolley, full of Russian soldiers, on Russian tracks.

Don't blame Zelensky for a war that was started by Russia.
