Arguing against memes on CN does not contribute to the goals of the community's needs: fighting fake news. It is abusive to the community to hold personal opinions and not support them with quality information.
The Elon meme is just an image with his point of view, not a fact.

NNN - To stop a war one side has to surrender, while Putin indeed is the agressor, Zelensky can negociate a ceasefire if he want to. What will be lost to Russia is to put in balance with what has been lost every day for the past 3 years

You can stop the tram at any moment, but you refuse because you are Putin, a nefarious war criminal who is caught up in his megalomaniacal world view and will only stop murdering people and conquering land once the old empire of the Soviet Union has been restored.

The reason Ukraine is refusing to agree to a ceasefire is because
only the distribution of resources is being discussed,
and there is no "security" that it has sought since the beginning of the war.
This is like the partition of Poland in the 21st century.

Elon misses the well-known mathematical notion of option value in an optimal stopping problem.

If the option of waiting can bring a better peace, it has a value that may exceed the value of stopping now.

Russia has a history of violating ceasefires for strategic advantage

Zelensky has requested guarantees of peace because the proposed peace agreements would force Ukraine to demilitarize, meaning they would not be able to defend themselves in any future wars.

Putin could end the war by simply leaving Ukraine. As Putin/Russia are the ones who started it by invading a sovereign country in the first place.

Zelensky‚Äôs position on Ukraine needing a guarantee is an accurate and fundamental due to Putin breaking the Minks Agreements of 2014 & 2015.

In fact, nobody offered Zelensky to stop the tram. What was offered was to stop resisting the tram from killing people (and agree to pay for this with the country's mineral resources), which would ultimately lead to more victims.

Now the USA menace total abandonment into Russia domination except rare ores are gifted. US/Ukraine corruption and overspending is no excuse https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0L5zAlMqME
