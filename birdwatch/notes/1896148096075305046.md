NNN - To stop a war one side has to surrender, while Putin indeed is the agressor, Zelensky can negociate a ceasefire if he want to. What will be lost to Russia is to put in balance with what has been lost every day for the past 3 years

Putin could end the war by simply leaving Ukraine. As Putin/Russia are the ones who started it by invading a sovereign country in the first place.

Uklraine was forced into war by the USA to secure resources and encroach Russia in the Black Sea (main commerce and military navy).

Zelensky‚Äôs position on Ukraine needing a guarantee is an accurate and fundamental due to Putin breaking the Minks Agreements of 2014 & 2015.

In fact, nobody offered Zelensky to stop the tram. What was offered was to stop resisting the tram from killing people (and agree to pay for this with the country's mineral resources), which would ultimately lead to more victims.

That is a Russian trolley, full of Russian soldiers, on Russian tracks.

Don't blame Zelensky for a war that was started by Russia.
