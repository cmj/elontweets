NNN. Personal opinion and also, the lack of arrests does not imply a lack of crime.

Thousands of lives have not been saved. 29 criminal aliens were arrested for manslaughter/ homicide in 2024. Claiming thousands are alive because of increased border security is statistically false and wildly illogical. There is zero data to support the claim in the video
