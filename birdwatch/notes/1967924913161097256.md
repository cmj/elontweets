@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: @Cernovich @JeffBezos I don’t think this jackass should be banned, but Amazon should stop paying him to incite murder. That’s insane.

NNN The post is purely opinion in context of streaming. No not is needed on the backstory of the streamer. That can be discussed in comments.
