The links in the proposed note do not equivocally state that the other attempted kidnapping did not happen. The police source “was unaware of” any other report, according to the links provided. https://t.co/ixATSgoWFw

There was a report of a possible attempt on a 14 year old. There was then a false report of an attempted abduction, which the school concerned apologised for. The police asked, not begged, locals not to take actions on this false report. Police patrols have been increased.
