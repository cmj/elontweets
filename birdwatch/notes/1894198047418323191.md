The U.S. bureaucracy is third in size behind China and India.  However, each of those countries have billions of people.  The word ‚Äúentrenched‚Äù can‚Äôt be measured and is a great example of why putting a CN on an opinion is asinine and counterproductive.

NNN.  The author is stating an opinion.  The reference given is data for govt effectiveness which has nothing to do with the opinion of ‚ÄúLargest most entrenched bureaucracy on Earth‚Äù

NNN the proposed note only talks about efficiency. The OP called the US bureaucracy large and entrenched. Those adjectives were not addressed in the note.

As of 2023, the USA ranks 24th in a list of 193 countries in terms of government efficiency. It is by no means the "largest most entrenched bureaucracy in the world".
