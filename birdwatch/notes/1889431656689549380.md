NNN - Elon posted a picture of himself and X in the Oval Office today with no caption. The picture is real.

Not AI, you‚Äôre just starting to lose the ability to tell between real and fake. 

Also, not on January 11th: it‚Äôs February. I know, it‚Äôs going by fast.

Its amazing that someone said this is AI Generated. This person literally couldnt take the time to check if Elon was in the Oval Office today. Maybe some people should be banned from community notes for being so careless.

NNN -  this is a screen grab or a still shot from January, 11, 2025.  Elon Musk and his son were in the Oval office with Trump and his son was on his shoulders for quite some time during the question and answer as evidenced by the below video
