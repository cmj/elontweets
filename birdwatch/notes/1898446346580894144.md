Burke has already spent 500 days in prison, and the Irish Courts are now punishing him further. This is horrific. https://t.co/c0gyRlIpgm | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1898446346580894144

 Enoch Burke is in prison for breaking a cout order not his religious beliefs.He is not being stripped of his salary because of his religious beliefs but because of fines relating to the court order

NNN - The court order comes from a disciplinary process at the school to keep Enoch away, which stems from his refusal to use they/them pronouns for a student. This is a roundabout way garnishing his wages for refusal to use they/them pronouns (to pay fines).

NNN - If a CN is needed, it should be on the original post, not the "Wow" comment
