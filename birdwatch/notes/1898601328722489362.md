The only time NATO protection was activated (Article 5) came after the 9/11 attacks, when NATO allies supported the U.S.

NNN. It is a political opinion. It is true only Europe has been required to defend USA so far, but it his opinion is that USA should not need to pay for the U.S. defense equipment and staff located in Europe.

NNN: The United States pays far more into NATO for defense of all the member nations in Europe. The NATO "protection" is ongoing during peace or war, hence the U.S. pays for their defense. The remainder of the OP is his opinion. CN mentioning article five is irrelevant.  https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/07/07/nato-countries-military-spending-contributions/70390384007/
