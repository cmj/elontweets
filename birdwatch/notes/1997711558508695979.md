The EU has two main governing bodies (a bit like the US House & Senate). The Parliament is directly elected by all EU citizens. The Commission has delegates appointed by every member country's government. Those governments are also directly elected by their citizens. https://european-union.europa.eu/institutions-law-budget/institutions-and-bodies/search-all-eu-institutions-and-bodies/european-parliament_en https://commission.europa.eu/about/organisation/how-commission-appointed_en

NNN - The post expresses a personal opinion, based upon the fact that while the EU Parliament has 705 members and the Council has 27, the bureaucracy consists of in excess of 60,000 unelected individuals who directly determine how to effect execution of rules and laws.

NNN: This is an opinion rather than a factually false statement. Only the EU Commission can propose law, and it is not directly elected. The president of the EU Commission is, in theory, elected, but they ran unopposed.

I lived in Germany from 1994-2018, and voter participation in EU elections was always much lower than in national or regional elections, because hardly anyone knew exactly what they were voting for. https://www.euronews.com/2019/05/20/why-do-so-few-people-vote-in-european-elections

Ww vote in Europen Elecuions for representatives, but not for governant that ara elected by these representatives, that often have  a distant, weak relation with our daily reality. And true, it is plenty of ignorant bureocrates.
