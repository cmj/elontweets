Information for those negatively noting this post:

They are currently accepting foreign volunteers into the Ukranian military.

You are free to get off of X and fight the Russians at any time.

That would be preferable to seeing young men forcibly conscripted to die.

The only diplomatic resolution to the Russo-Ukrainian War that upholds Ukrainian sovereignty and international law is for Putin to unilaterally order the full withdrawal of Russian forces to Russia's internationally recognized borders.

It's about Liberty, not property.

As Americans had won liberty from UK, Ukrainians are trying to win liberty from Russia. That's it.

 Elon never appeals to Russian leadership which is responsible for unleashing the war to end it.

Ukraine merely defends itself and has no choice in that matter.
