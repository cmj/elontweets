@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: My deepest condolences to the families of the two National Guardsmen who were murdered in cold blood today.

Reports of at least one NG man being shot in the head. Story is developing. Here’s a link to CPR being done to NG solider. It’s too early to quote news who is behind. Initially news said one stable, 1 critical. https://x.com/nicksortor/status/1993826343427985705?s=46

The National Guardsmen are in critical condition.

"West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that the guard members were from his state and had died, but he later walked that back, saying his office had received 'conflicting reports' about their status."
