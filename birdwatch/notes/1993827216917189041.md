Reports of at least one NG man being shot in the head. Story is developing. Here’s a link to CPR being done to NG solider. It’s too early to quote news who is behind. Initially news said one stable, 1 critical. https://x.com/nicksortor/status/1993826343427985705?s=46

The National Guardsmen are in critical condition.

"West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that the guard members were from his state and had died, but he later walked that back, saying his office had received 'conflicting reports' about their status."
