The Gondorians built the fortress, but eventually gifted it to the Rohirrim. Thus, the fortress (Hornburg) at Helm’s Deep belongs to Rohan. The judge would “legally” & “technically” have to be Rohirrim.

Gondor judges considered Orcs “within the Law…Captives must not be tormented, not even to discover information for the defence of homes… If any Orcs surrendered and asked for mercy, they must be granted it, even at a cost.”
