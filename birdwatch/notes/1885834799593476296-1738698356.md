If it isn't a de facto lease from the government then don't pay your property taxes for several years and see what happens. If you have to pay a yearly amount to keep property that you paid for that is decided by the people receiving the money, then it is a lease.

NNN - Post expresses an opinion. Take disagreements to  comments where they can be debated openly.

NNN. Post is an opinion. Also, post doesn’t claim property taxes don’t pay for things. You don’t need to CN every single time Elon posts.

NNN. De facto doesn't mean literally and Elon isn't saying you literally lease your house from the government. It is true that failure to pay property taxes could result in the government seizing your home to pay your delinquent taxes even if you fully paid off your mortgage.

Note not need. 

Public safety, public education, and more could and should be funded by means by other than property taxes. 

Under property tax system, when elderly lose their income, can't pay taxes, they lose their property to the state. This is immoral and anti American.

This is false.  Just because you pay for the privilege of living in a functioning society does not mean you “lease” your home from the government.

Further context is needed.  Public safety, public education, and more are funded by property taxes.
