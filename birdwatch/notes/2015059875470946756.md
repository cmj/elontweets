The claim that Adolf Hitler was a "far left socialist" based primarily on the name "National Socialist German Workers' Party"(NSDAP) is misleading. Historians across the political spectrum classify Nazism as a far-right ideology characterized by extreme nationalism and racism!

Hitler stated in 1930: "Our adopted term 'Socialist' has nothing to do with Marxist Socialism." The Nazi Party's name included 'Socialist', but Nazism was a far-right ideology. He outlawed socialist parties and sent socialists to concentration camps.

Historians widely classify Nazism as far-right fascism, emphasizing extreme nationalism, anti-communism, and racial hierarchy. The "socialist" label was rhetorical for worker appeal, not Marxist egalitarianism

Misleading. Historians classify Nazism as far-right fascism, not far-left socialism, despite the "National Socialist" name. Nazis were anti-Marxist & persecuted socialists/communists. https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nazism https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-nazi-party-1

The Party was called NSDAP "nationalsozialistische deutsche Arbeiter Partei", it would translate in to national socialist German workers party.
It was obviously a socialist movement.

NNN 
October 1923 Interview :
HITLER: "Socialism is the science of dealing with the common weal. Communism
is not Socialism. Marxism is not Socialism. The Marxians have stolen the term and
confused its meaning. I shall take Socialism away from the Socialists."

NNN. The note conflates socialism with Marxism. While Hitler opposed Marxists, the Nazi economy was a command economy where the state controlled production, prices, and wages. The regime was fundamentally collectivist and redistributive, rejecting free-market individualism.

Hitler aboga por la desaparición de la propiedad privada y era partidario del control de la economía y planificación por el estado, al igual que en la URSS.

Like socialist revolutions in Russia and China around the same time, the Nazi’s  “party’s socialist orientation was basically a demagogic gambit designed to attract support from the working class” only to be replaced by authoritarian dictators once the state had control.

NNN - Being against Marxist don't mean you're not socialist. Historian can revisit facts or twist them but it don't change the reality.

NNN. Stop abusing community notes. It's a FACT that Hitler's party was called the National Socialists. The opinion of some historians are exactly that... opinions. Other historians consider Naziism far-left socialism. DISAGREEMENT BELONGS IN THE COMMENTS.

NNN - Whether Hitler is far left or far right is opinionated. Hitler and Nazism share many characteristics of both the far right and far left and can’t be said to explicitly be one or the other. Keep community notes not biased and all arguing in the comments.
