A quick internet search will yield many articles holding the the belief that the Biden Presidency was Obama's third term. 

Dr. Hanson should be considered an expert on this subject matter and his opinion matches numerous others.

The video is painting the idea that Biden's presidency was an "Obama third term" as fact without any sources. 

There has never been any evidence to suggest Obama has influence over the current White House.
