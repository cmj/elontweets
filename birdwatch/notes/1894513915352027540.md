The counter point may be excellent, but legal opinions are opinions. The debate must happen in the comments, not CN. US law is a debate, and the branches fight. NNN

Note is needed precisely because it is an order from the judiciary.  

Branches of government aren't supposed to fight, they each have their own tasks. 

In this case elon is misinforming the public by saying it undermines democracy

The role of the judiciary is not to uphold “the democratic will of the people”, it is to interpret and apply the constitution and laws. This is not subject to the will of the people, by design. 

See Hamilton, Federalist No. 78 and Madison, Federalist 10 and 51.
