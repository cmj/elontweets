[Tue Feb 25, 2025 22:24:50 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: When judges egregiously undermine the democratic will of the people, they must be fired or democracy dies! [@RepOgles] 🚨INCOMING: NEW ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT🚨 I’m drafting articles of impeachment for U.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali. Yet another PARTISAN ACTIVIST attempting to weaponize his position to block President Trump from cutting wasteful foreign funding. Accountability is key. https://t.co/UZUslAd1qT | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1894513915352027540

The counter point may be excellent, but legal opinions are opinions. The debate must happen in the comments, not CN. US law is a debate, and the branches fight. NNN

Elon Musk is considering democracy as immediate will of the people - Aristotele is calling this a corrupt government

However, the constitution of the U.S.A. is specifically designed to address shortcomings of the "simple" democracy - Aristotele would call the US Polity.

Note is needed precisely because it is an order from the judiciary.  

Branches of government aren't supposed to fight, they each have their own tasks. 

In this case elon is misinforming the public by saying it undermines democracy

The role of the judiciary is not to uphold “the democratic will of the people”, it is to interpret and apply the constitution and laws. This is not subject to the will of the people, by design. 

See Hamilton, Federalist No. 78 and Madison, Federalist 10 and 51.
