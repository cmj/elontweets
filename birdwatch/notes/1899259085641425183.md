When illegal aliens were granted amnesty by Reagan in exchange for tighter immigration controls, the voting makeup of CA was changed and the promised immigration controls were never fully implemented.

Illegal aliens living in the states effect apportionment in the House.

I live in California. Just because they say you can't do it doesn't mean they're actually checking to make sure it doesn't happen.

They don't even check IDs here.  They offer to register you to vote at the DMV & DPSS, both places illegals have access to. They dgaf here.
