NNN - We do not write CN‚Äôs on media for adding their logos, tickers, or for adding text which provides additional context.  The video included in the suggested not confirmed this is real.

NNN - What is being referred to as real is the content of the photograph itself and is not invalidated by the presence of added text.

This picture has been digitally altered to include the text "The Dogefather". However, the rest of the image is real.

Elon Musk added "Dodgefather" to the image, making the post false. Likewise, the label clashes with his actions as a real parent. Grimes publicly begged him to address their child‚Äôs urgent health issue, but he chose this. Thus, even the implication of being a father misleading:
