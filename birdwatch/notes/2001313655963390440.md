Low rates (e.g., Poland) often indicate underreporting & stigma; high rates (e.g., Sweden, UK) reflect broader definitions & better support.
Higher numbers can mean stronger systems, not more crime.

NNN.

To the user that made the same CN for both posts: CN that have "often indicate" and "can mean" belong in the comment section.

The source isnt much better: a fact check, instead of real studies linking the numbers under a deep analysis of correlation?

Stop abusing CN!!!

NNN this is an opinion in reaction to a post posing a question. Neither needs a note. Disagreements belong in comments.
