[Fri Feb 21, 2025 20:49:50 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)„Äêùóï„Äë: Only AfD can save Germany [@EvaVlaar] Yet another knife attack in Berlin this time. Multiple people are injured, one severely. As for now, the attacker is still on the loose. Europe is a totally unsafe place nowadays, but when @JDVance states that fact European leaders lose their minds. AfD all the way. https://t.co/1XMWNKeVHd | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1893040457803813322

The study claiming immigration has not raised German crime rates is flawed because it uses aggregate district-level data, potentially masking higher crime rates among specific immigrant groups due to an ecological fallacy.

NNN - It is Musk's personal opinion. Put the note in the original  post, not this one.

Germany's 2025 ifo study found no link between immigration & crime rates. The AfD has repeatedly misrepresented crime stats (95% foreign suspects vs official 35%). Current Berlin attack has no confirmed suspect details.
