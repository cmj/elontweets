Note Needed. This isn't an actual dire wolf. It's a grey wolf that was genetically modified to appear as a dire wolf.

Romulus and Remus aren’t true dire wolves, they’re genetically engineered modern wolves with around 20 genes edited to mimic dire wolf traits. Due to current scientific limits, we can’t fully recreate extinct species or replicate their DNA with complete accuracy; yet.

NN - 1st note provides important context while having very non-biased language.

NNN
It's very tiring and high time that CN abusers gets dismissed forever of that role after 3 NNN (Suggestion).
You have no qualification to judge how much of gene editing exploit is enough, or not, to disqualify these puppies from belonging to the Dire Wolf species.

NNN - this is an image of a magazine cover, nothing else.  Take your issues up with Time or in the comments.

NNN- This is purely a link to a Time magazine article, it makes no claims about the article nor does it state that Dire Wolves exist. There appears to be a number of community noters who wait for Elon Musk to tweet just to try to discredit his posts, this is getting quite stupid.

Added context: Romulus and Remus are actually Dire Wolves in morphology & behaviour; let’s analyse the claims by Colossal:

YES they have Aenocyon DNA, but just a bit under the .5% needed to fix the gap. They (much like their ancestors) share 99.5% DNA w/ wolves.

NNN. This is tiring. Finger wagger has no idea how many traits are necessary to replicate a "species". If it quacks like a duck...

"These edits were designed to produce... larger body, heavier jaw, muscular limbs, and distinct vocalizations."

It's one step closer.

 A post of this nature benefits greatly from comments, and the COMMENTS are far more likely to be seen in a timely manner. 
  I learn so much from CN and wish more CN-writers would post *live* in comments.  https://communitynotes.x.com/guide/en/about/introduction
