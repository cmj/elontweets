Citizens are directly represented at EU level in the European Parliament

EU countries are represented: 
a.In the European Council  by their heads of state or government.

2. In the Council of the EU by their governments (“themselves democratically accountable to their citizens)

The EU doesn’t have a single leader. The European Council President is chosen by the EU heads of state and the Commission President nominated by the Council but approved by the directly elected Parliament. All decision makers are democratically elected and there’s no committee

The president of the European Commission is elected by the European Parliament, following a proposal of the Prime Ministers of the member states, themselves also democratically elected.

This is Musks opinion

The EU parliament is a rubber stamping exercise like the supreme Soviet were

All the power is concentrated in the EU commission

1. This is Musk's opinion

2. The President of the European Commission is nominated by the European Council and must then be approved by the European Parliament. This is not an election, just as the US Senate doesn't elect nominees of the government, but confirms them.

Many CN authors on this post and related others seem to be from US or outside the EU and don’t know how things in the EU are.
