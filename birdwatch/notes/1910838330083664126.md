The Treasury Department explained that since March started on a weekend, $83 billion in benefit payments were shifted into February. Without this shift, the March deficit would have been $244bn, an increase of $24bn or 11% from a year earlier. There was no reduced spending.

March 2025 budget deficit decreased by 32%, or $76bn, compared t9 previous year reaching $161bn. The decline was primarily due to a calendar shift for certain federal payments, which were moved into the previous month, and Not due to changes in actual spending or receipts!
