It is Elon expressing his oppinion. Therefore its freedom of speech and freedom of opinion. No note needed. I join the other person in asking to stop abusing community notes?

Not only is no note needed, it's not even Musk's image.  He shared another user's post and commented with an emoji.  Stop abusing CN!

Elon Musk’s image misrepresents public services. Universal healthcare lowers costs, education boosts earnings, and infrastructure fuels growth. Musk benefits from taxpayer-funded subsidies and contracts, making his criticism hypocritical.
