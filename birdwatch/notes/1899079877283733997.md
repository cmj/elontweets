It is not "a judge", it's the Constitutional Court, the equivalent of Supreme Court in US. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Court_of_Romania

It was not a judge but the constitutional court similar to the one in USA that made the decision in the last round of elections. The decision in question here was made by BEC that is like a board formed of members of each parliamentary party in romania that voted 10/14 for this https://www.bursa.ro/georgescu-tramples-on-bec-his-candidacy-was-rejected-23300556

This video purposefully omits the part where the crowds started throwing pieces of pavement in the police forces and provoked a response, after more than 2 hours of peaceful protests. The actions of police were quite mellow and calm.
