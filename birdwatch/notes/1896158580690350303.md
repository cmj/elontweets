[Sun Mar 02, 2025 11:20:09 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)„Äêùóï„Äë: What I said over 2 years ago was that Ukraine should seek peace or suffer severe loss of life for no gains.  The latter was Zelensky‚Äôs choice.  Now, he wants to do that again.  This is cruel and inhumane. [@elonmusk] Ukraine-Russia Peace: - Redo elections of annexed regions under UN supervision. Russia leaves if that is will of the people. - Crimea formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783 (until Khrushchev‚Äôs mistake). - Water supply to Crimea assured. - Ukraine remains neutral. | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1896158580690350303

Zelensky, represents Ukrainians, as confirmed by recent polls showing their demand for lasting security, not quick fixes.

In 1994, Ukraine gave up the world‚Äôs third-largest nuclear arsenal for guarantees now ignored, while US shifts borders and blame to victim.

Ukraine surrendered the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal in 1994 after receiving security assurances from the US.

Later, weakened, Ukraine was invaded.

Zelensky: "I want peace, but with guarantees" - meaning enforceable ceasefire terms, not just promises.

Elon Musk using his platform to push incorrect and manipulative propaganda in the recent times. He keeps putting the weight of the conflict on the Ukrainian side constantly but never addresses the aggressor‚Äôs responsibilities as well. He masks his opinions as facts.

Elon is correct that 2 years of needless deaths have occured with the frontline barely changing. The entire context of this argument is biased however as it ignores any fault or blame towards Russia. Infact, you would be hard pressed to find him ever criticize Russia at all
