Only 0.85% of defendants of criminal cases try an insanity plea, only 0.26% are successful.

A successful insanity plea usually leads to involuntary treatment, which means containment twice as long as the proposed prison sentence.

NN/NNN - Unsure whether claims are or are not true, but a Grok tweet is definitely not a reliable source. Someone with more information on the subject should provide a quote with proper sourcing.
