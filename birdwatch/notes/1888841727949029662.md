NNN. Expresses opinion. CN claims the word "significant" is debatable, which is exactly why this is an opinion by the OP.

NNN. Please do not comment "missing important context" without describing the "important context" that is supposedly missing. 
The post is factually correct.
Take your arguments to the comments section, not CN.

Although for some it seems that 9.5% is not an important representation in parliament, this post is in no way misleading since it expresses a personal appreciation.

Claiming that the EFF is not significant as they have 9.52% is misleading.  

South Africa uses Proportional representation system, and the EFF could with the ANC and another party with just 3 seats in parliament, form a new coalition.

NNN. Saying "missing important context" while not providing any is nothing but your opinion, which does not belong to CN. Take it to the comment.

The EFF political party (which Malema leads), although the fourth largest, was only voted for by 9.5% of the electorate in the 2024 South African elections. Whether they are a "significant" party is debatable.

The video is from 2018 and missing important context.
