NNN. The OP has clearly stated a fact on money wasted . He has  not used the word ‚Äòtaxpayer‚Äô for which 6 people have added community notes. Seems people want to correct Musk without reading what‚Äôs he saying!

The organization is funded by private donations. This was not taxpayer funded according to Datarepublican who broke this story.

There is no verifiable evidence that U.S. taxpayer money was given to Norm Eisen or the States United Democracy Center. SUDC is a nonprofit typically funded by private donations and grants, not government funds. SUDC primarily works on election integrity cases.
