Magnetic Rainforest Dipper did not accurately read the post. $4.1m was given in Aug ‚Äò24 - in ONE MONTH, not in all 2021. Also, if u add up all donations in the picture, the total given by US Gov to NYT in last 5 years was $58 million! Raindeer completely misunderstood this post.

The payments in this keyword search are not going to the NY Times. Most are going to New York University and other universities in NY
