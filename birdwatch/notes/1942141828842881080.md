factual and physical error; AI Video Generation is NOT advancing at the speed of light; Only massless particles, including photons, which make up light, can travel at the speed.

Claims that AI video is advancing “at the speed of light” are figure of speech. Tech progress depends on human research and hardware — it doesn’t literally move at 300,000 km/s. Stanford AI Index 2024 shows actual growth rates. https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index
