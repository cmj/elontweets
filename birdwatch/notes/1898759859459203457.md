Poland is paying $4.2 mln per month. Retail price in the UK is ¬£50 or ¬£96 per month. So Poland pays retail  price for 40000 or 80000 terminals. With quantity I would assume price should be significantly lower, so Musk is receiving good business rather than paying small cost.

Radoslaw Sikorski is 1.81m / 5ft11¬º. This is average height for a Polish man, but note that Poles are exceptionally tall; in the US he would be on the 76th percentile making Musk's description  of him as small highly inaccurate.

Contrary to what Musk said, there‚Äôs actually another supplier : Eutelsat, which is French. There are ongoing negotiations with the Ukrainian army, according to Bloomberg.

The largest single contributor of Starlink terminals in Ukraine is Poland with payment for almost 9,000 individual terminals.

Ukraine uses approximately 25,000 terminals.
Their costs in 85% are covered by goverments of Poland, UK, and USA. In February Poland alone ordered another 5,000 terminals.

NNN - guys stop writing notes if you don‚Äôt know what you are talking about. 
Yes it‚Äôs true that Poland pays the majority of the costs for the terminals, but that doesn‚Äôt mean what Elon musk said is not true. There are operating costs too, wich exceed terminal costs over time.

Eutelsat is not even remotely comparable to Starlink. Eutelsat currently has only 34 geostationary satellites, while S. has 8069. Eutelsat doesn't even have a launcher at the level of Elon Musk's SpaceX launchers, Ariane 4 which is already and is still in the testing phase. https://www.eutelsat.it/home.html

$50 million per year doesn't cover even a single starlink batch launch. So what poland pays for is indeed a fraction of the actual costs.

It isn't disputed by Elon in the X post that Poland is a customer, nor numbers of units. However, he has the best information as to how much they actually pay and what it costs to maintain the coverage over Ukraine. The notes are fact checking the person who would know best ...
