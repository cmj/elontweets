The post indicates that a filibuster defeat will be required to pass the law. While current Senate rules could permit Democratic Senators to engage in a filibuster, this is a rule and can be changed.  They might vote for what the people clearly want.

The SAVE Act would need to break the filibuster, meaning it needs 60 senators (12 more, not 2) to support it, not 50.

The majority can force a a standing filibuster to require the opposing side to actively hold the floor and speak continuously rather than relying on “zombie” 
.   It is time intensive requiring the minority to finally yield, exhausts there speakers or agrees to cloture.

The other CNs are not necessary and would be more appropriate in the comments.

The non-talking filibuster has only been around in recent decades. Before then, it was a talking filibuster.  With 50 senators, it could go up for debate, which the filibuster is for.
