The SAVE Act would need to break the filibuster, meaning it needs 60 senators (12 more, not 2) to support it, not 50.

The majority can force a a standing filibuster to require the opposing side to actively hold the floor and speak continuously rather than relying on “zombie” 
.   It is time intensive requiring the minority to finally yield, exhausts there speakers or agrees to cloture.

The non-talking filibuster has only been around in recent decades. Before then, it was a talking filibuster.  With 50 senators, it could go up for debate, which the filibuster is for.
