The Cybertruck is available to drive in Fortnite and is not resistant to these weapons as it explodes with enough bullets.

While the steel paneling of the Cybertruck is highly resistant to gunfire, far more so than that used in most other commercially available cars, there are certain handgun rounds that it will not stop, such as .44 Magnum and .50 Action Express.

Elon is expressing an opinion that encompass a majority of small arms that are widely owned by a majority of gun owners. Their will always be an exemption to every thought, so while his opinion is wrong on paper, it is majorly true. The exemptions belong in the comments.
