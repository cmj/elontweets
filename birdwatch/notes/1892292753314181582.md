[Wed Feb 19, 2025 19:18:44 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)„Äêùóï„Äë: Zelensky cannot claim to represent the will of the people of Ukraine unless he restores freedom of the press and stops canceling elections! [@RapidResponse47] In America, we hold a presidential election every four years -- even during wartime. We held an election during the Civil War. We held an election during World War II. Before President Zelenskyy decides to lecture the American President again, he should hold an election too. | ‚Ü≥ 22,988 ‚áÖ 24,445 ‚ô• 139,885 ü°ï 21,724,499 | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1892292753314181582

Crimea, a part of Ukraine, was already under russian control since 2014

However 2019 the presidential elections took place and Selenskyj got president.

Obviously Ukraine could hold elections.

NNN - Just because a government passes a law restricting Democracy, doesn't mean that law is democratic or is in the interest of Democracy. Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries in the region. A law that keeps a party in power forever is inherently undemocratic.

NNN:  Save it for the comments, especially you dauntless sea tinamou.  That's clearly a whataboutism.  I thought we were just here to provide context for the readers not our personal feelings. As for the rest, if you cannot have an election because a law, then it is tyrannical.

Ukraine is since 24th February 2022 under the invasion and partial occupation from a foreign country which is Russia. For this reason a Martial Law is into effect. Ukrainian Constitution forbids celebrating elections during a Martial Law.

Funny that Musk doesn't hold Putin to the same standard.

Elections in Russia are neither free nor fair. There's no free speech in Russia. The leaders of the opposition are either in exile or in jail.

Putin has been in power since 1999.

The Ukrainian Constitution states that during martial law, it is illegal to have elections.  Due to Russia's ongoing invasion and occupation of Ukraine, the country is under wartime martial law.

Ukraine is a sovereign state, it was invaded by an expansionist empire.

The Ukrainian Constitution states that during martial law, it is illegal to have elections.  Due to Russia's ongoing invasion and occupation of Ukraine, the country is under martial law and it cannot be lifted. Therefore the posts claim is false.
