[Wed Feb 19, 2025 19:18:44 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)„Äêùóï„Äë: Zelensky cannot claim to represent the will of the people of Ukraine unless he restores freedom of the press and stops canceling elections! [@RapidResponse47] In America, we hold a presidential election every four years -- even during wartime. We held an election during the Civil War. We held an election during World War II. Before President Zelenskyy decides to lecture the American President again, he should hold an election too. | ‚Ü≥ 34,813 ‚áÖ 42,675 ‚ô• 244,463 ü°ï 49,041,260 | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1892292753314181582

NNN - Just because a government passes a law restricting Democracy, doesn't mean that law is democratic or is in the interest of Democracy. Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries in the region. A law that keeps a party in power forever is inherently undemocratic.

NNN:  Save it for the comments, especially you dauntless sea tinamou.  That's clearly a whataboutism.  I thought we were just here to provide context for the readers not our personal feelings. As for the rest, if you cannot have an election because a law, then it is tyrannical.

Crimea, a part of Ukraine, was already under russian control since 2014

However 2019 the presidential elections took place and Selenskyj got president.

Obviously Ukraine could hold elections.

The OP expresses the author's opinion saying that freedom of the press must be restored and consequently with transparent information the people can elect their own representative through voting. The proposed notes go in the comments.

"A leader who bans free elections under martial law and clings to power after the crisis, against the people‚Äôs will, embodies tyranny. Who truly defends democracy in Ukraine‚Äîthe leader?"

Art 83 of the Constitution pertains solely to the cancellation of Rada (parliamentary) elections and does not apply to the President, who is not a member of the Rada. Article 103 defines the President‚Äôs term and provides no basis for extending it beyond the specified duration.

Elon Musk and Donald Trump are spreading Russian Propaganda since Trump's meeting with Putin. 

Elon Musk is, for the first time, on the wrong side of history and it is very sad to see for us who defended him the whole time.

Ukraine is since 24th February 2022 under the invasion and partial occupation from a foreign country which is Russia. For this reason a Martial Law is into effect. Ukrainian Constitution forbids celebrating elections during a Martial Law.

Funny that Musk doesn't hold Putin to the same standard.

Elections in Russia are neither free nor fair. There's no free speech in Russia. The leaders of the opposition are either in exile or in jail.

Putin has been in power since 1999.

The Ukrainian Constitution states that during martial law, it is illegal to have elections.  Due to Russia's ongoing invasion and occupation of Ukraine, the country is under wartime martial law.

The Ukrainian Constitution states that during martial law, it is illegal to have elections.  Due to Russia's ongoing invasion and occupation of Ukraine, the country is under martial law and it cannot be lifted. Therefore the posts claim is false.
