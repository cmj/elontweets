@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: What are the statistics on trans violence? The probability of a trans person being violent appears to be vastly higher than non-trans. Hormone injections cause extreme emotional volatility. That is simply a fact. | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1902738447124545797

The study submitted to the UK Parliament (cited by Grapefruit Bullfinch) is a small sample for the period ending 2003 - 22 years ago, long before the extreme increase in trans conversions. There is little reason to believe it applies to current transitioned people.

These are false and entirely unsupported statements. This new @motherjones article offers accurate information about this baseless fear mongering.  https://x.com/MotherJones/status/1902845555484619255

This study for the UK Parliament is one of many that concluded that MtF transexuals retain male patterns of offending after transition. In other words, they are no more nor less likely than any man to offend. OP presents speculation as fact, and that speculation is incorrect.

This is a question, and an opinion. Notes are not needed for either.

There is no study currently available and sufficiently robust to support or disprove OP thesis that trans individuals have a higher propensity for violence than general population. NNN. Fight it out in comments.

That isn't a study, it's some rough calculations. That type of thing might seem convincing to a general audience, but there are plenty of reasons this wouldn't be taken seriously if it were a real study (statistical significance, for one).
