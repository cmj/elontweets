This study for the UK Parliament is one of many that concluded that MtF transexuals retain male patterns of offending after transition. In other words, they are no more nor less likely than any man to offend. OP presents speculation as fact, and that speculation is incorrect.

That isn't a study, it's some rough calculations. That type of thing might seem convincing to a general audience, but there are plenty of reasons this wouldn't be taken seriously if it were a real study (statistical significance, for one).
