@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: My companies make great products that people love and I’ve never physically hurt anyone. So why the hate and violence against me?

And an estimated 819,300 people could die within a year without American foreign aid for H.I.V. prevention and treatment. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/15/opinion/foreign-aid-cuts-impact.html

Elon Musk, ao focar em tornar os Estados Unidos mais eficientes e controlar seus gastos, adota uma abordagem pragmática que visa melhorar a alocação de recursos públicos. A ideia central é garantir que os fundos dos contribuintes sejam utilizados de maneira eficaz.

Clearly the CN link states that Trump & Elon cut funding in January.  That is factually untrue.

President Trump was not sworn in until 20 January 2025.

Cuts to USAID began in Feb.
