The word ‘tsunami’ is not a term to be used casually.

NNN-Use of the word "tsunami" to describe the overwhelming force or presence of something is a common metaphor. Writing a CN to rebuke the literal meaning is abuse of CNs. This would be appropriate for comments.

NNN - Musk used the word tsunami in a figurative form. Do not use the CN for that. The other CN stating that tsunami is a strong word. It could be for some, still anyone can use it.
