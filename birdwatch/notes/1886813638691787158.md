This video shows a peaceful, lawful protest.

On January 6th, 2021, a violent insurrection was attempted. A mob stormed the US Capitol attempting to overthrow the elected government.

Many perpetrators were arrested and tried by Trump-appointed judges. Several pled guilty.

A violent mob stormed the Capitol on Jan 6th 21 to stop the certification of the vote for the then elected Joe Biden. This alone makes it an insurrection. Donald Trump used this to plant false electors to overthrow the election to steal power and remain president. It failed
