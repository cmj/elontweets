[Mon Feb 10, 2025 06:54:57 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: A high price was long since paid [@SohailSNAhmed] Britain spent half its treasury to free slaves. The loan we took out in 1834 do so (we had to pay the slave owners) we only paid back fully in 2014. We freed 800,000 slaves and even policed the seas to capture slave ships to free the slaves onboard.

NNN It’s not true that the British Government gave nothing to the slaves. They made annual grants for 10 years following emancipation to create the basis of a new society for the freed slaves. 
And, more recently, £billions in foreign aid.

OP leaves out that compensation was paid to slave  owners and their descendants, not to slaves or their descendants.
