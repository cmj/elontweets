[Mon Feb 24, 2025 16:41:16 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)„Äêùóï„Äë: Polls show that @DOGE is overwhelmingly POPULAR and that government spending should be reduced by at least $1 trillion!! [@libsoftiktok] This new poll is absolutely devastating to the Democrats. DOGE is EXTREMELY popular by huge margins. They screeched about it for weeks on every show and publication but the American people didn‚Äôt fall for it. Just shows how irrelevant the media and leftist talking heads are. https://t.co/H2El8Ge4AC | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1894065065340403899
