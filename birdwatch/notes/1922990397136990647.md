Even though I was born in South Africa, the government will not grant @Starlink a license to operate simply because I am not black.

Starlink isn't allowed to operate in South Africa, but not because Musk is not black. It's because they do not comply with local laws. Additionally, Starlink has not applied to the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) for a license.

nnn: The BBEE framework says this "A company must have at least 30% black ownership (as defined in the B-BBEE Codes of Good Practice) to comply with licensing requirements in certain sectors."

So if Elon was Black he can get the license for Starlink. As he is not, he cannot.

NNN. If Elon was black, Starlink would meet the local regulations to operate in SA. He isn’t going to apply when he knows it will be rejected.
