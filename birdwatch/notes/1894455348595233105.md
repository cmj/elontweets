The map Petersen is using is a globe, not a flat map. The great circle or geodesic path from lax to houston is indeed, a straight line.

NNN. Since both San Francisco (37.77°N) and Houston (29.76°N) are relatively close in latitude and the distance between them is moderate (~1,650 miles), the deviation from a straight-line path on a standard map is minimal.

This route deviates from a direct path of a flight from San Francisco to Houston, there are reasons for this such as winds, traffic, and storm systems that the pilots are trying to avoid. The earth is also curved meaning the most direct path is not necessarily a straight line.

Planes must fly in a non-straight line to get to the location faster. The Earth is not flat. There is curvature.
