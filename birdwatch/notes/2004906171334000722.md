"Eighteen percent of Black adult citizens, 15% of Hispanic adult citizens, and 13% of Asian/Pacific Islander adult citizens do not
have a license at all, compared to just 5% of White adult citizens."

I got my Voter ID in Puerto Rico in 1980, since then, EVERY citizen of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico needs a Voter Photo ID to vote.  How come a WHOLE island can do this quickly and reliably and we can't do it here in the US.

The video is a collection of opinions. 

Furthermore the reference itself states that most ineligible voters have expired drivers licenses, meaning they are capable of getting a drivers license as the opinions state in the video.

NNN The CN suggested refers to rates of licensure, not rates of identification. It is not relevant, and belongs in the comment section.

Proposed note cites statistics on driver’s licenses. Other forms of photo ID are available from states. Findings summarized by VoteRiders show these numbers to be considerably lower when including all IDs. Also, all states that require IDs provide a free ID option.

Note not needed - It's a video of people's opinions, no claim is being made. Nothing is being presented as facts.
