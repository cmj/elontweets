Elon is not using correct word, he misrepresenting between Hakenkreuz and Swastik. Swastik is scared symbol worship by Hindus which teaches peace, equality, love and respect for humanity.

Where as Hakenkreuz is the symbol of Nazi Germany.

The Swastika Is Not Hitler's Hakenkreuz.
These are two different things. Swastika holds nothing hateful and hold great cultural and religious significance for Hindus, Buddhists, Jain’s and many other communities.
While Hakenkreuz is the Symbil of Nazi hatred.

If you want to argue that the Nazi symbol which is extremely commonly called a swastika is not in fact a swastika, you should do it in the comments, not in CN. Elon is using a common term for the symbol which no one is misunderstanding.

Musk is being called a Nazi by those who are vandalizing property. It's exactly as he said.
