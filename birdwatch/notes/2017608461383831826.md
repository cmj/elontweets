@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: What matters is not release of some subset of the Epstein files, but rather the prosecution of those who committed heinous crimes with Epstein. When there is at least one arrest, some justice will have been done. If not, this is all performative.

Elon Musk’s name is mentioned in several new Epstein files from 2012-2014, including email exchanges in which Musk inquired about a potential visit to Epstein Island and wanted to know what night will be the “wildest party.”

NNN - Stop using community notes to express opinion, feelings or facts not related to the original post. The fact that Musk is named on the list does not mean his claim is false.
