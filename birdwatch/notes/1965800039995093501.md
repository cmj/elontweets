@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: Legacy news like AP is super racist against Whites (and Asians). Either capitalize all races or none. That would be fair and equal treatment, but only lowercase for Whites is racist by definition! | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1965800039995093501

AP explains they capitalize "Black" due to shared cultural/historical identity from discrimination, but lowercase "white" because white people lack unified cultural experience tied to race, not due to racism. https://www.ap.org/the-definitive-source/announcements/why-we-will-lowercase-white/
