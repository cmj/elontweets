@elonmusk (Elon Musk)【𝗕】: This has been happening for years. Ilhan Omar is the most obvious example. A large number of relatively recently arrived Somalis will elect only a Somali to Congress in that Minnesota district. This is much more subtle, but just as bad, in many other parts of America. | Twitter for iPhone | 𝚋𝚒𝚛𝚍𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 | https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/2010783100016738796

#### MISLEADING

[[view note]](https://x.com/i/birdwatch/n/2010950596115759174) - nimble-persimmon-pipit (Shown notes: 0 · Rating impact: 33)\
Per the U.S. Census, MN Con. Dist. 5, which Rep Omar was elected to, is 61% white and only 13.4% foreign-born.  To imply or state that immigrants, specifically Somalis, documented or not, are why she won, is at the very least in bad faith.
