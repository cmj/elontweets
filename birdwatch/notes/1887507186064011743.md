NNN. It clearly states USAID "and" other agencies, it does not single out USAID and claim it alone provided that to politico. It then presents a question and you can't manipulate context of someone else's questions. Too many mooks in community notes.

NNN - post does not say how much specifically came from all sources, no need to fact check one amount from one source when it clearly says ‚Äúand others‚Äù.

NNN the post by Trump claims that the US Aid and other agencies paid politico.  It does not say the was USAID only like some other community are writing.

NNN. "At USAID and OTHER AGENCIES"

The screenshot is not refering to USAID exclusively so all the notes claiming that not all the funds came from USAID are irrelevant, it's already stated that the number comes from several sources besides USAID.

NNN.  This is a screenshot.  It is sharing what our president posted on another platform.  It neither expresses an opinion or argues a point.

The source is the post itself.

Current community note links to an answer from Grok which claims: "the $8 million figure refers to the total amount Politico received... over a period from 2016 to fiscal year 2025"

Politico LLC received 8.4 million dollars from federal agencies in FY 2024 alone.

NNN - President Trump simply mentioned that USAID had specifically given money to Politico, not the entire $8 million. The federal government has indeed paid Politico $8 million.

Elon has shared a post from President where he expressed his OPINION (seems to have received - he's not stating it as a fact). Let's not abuse the Community Notes.

While Politico has received over $8M from the US federal government, only $44K came from USAID.

The government spending database only shows $44,000 of USAID spending on Politico in two transactions . Both were for subscriptions, not grants.

Politico LLC received 8.4 million dollars from federal agencies in 2025. A fraction of this amount came from USAID. That said, it seems USAiD were used to influence the media in general.
