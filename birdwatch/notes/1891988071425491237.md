NNN - There was no commentary on this post, only a video was shared, the user is able to draw their own conclusions. 

Ukrainian presidential elections were cancelled in 2024 and polling is likely unreliable due to restrictions on freedom of speech and press in the country.

NNN - To quote very old polls is ridiculous. The PRESIDENT of the United States likely has information that isn't available to the public. Particularly about polling. To say Zelenskyy has a 52% approval rating is laughable.

The claim that Zelenskyy‚Äôs approval ratings are at 4% is false. Latest polls show approval ratings of 52% inDecember 2024, down from 77% in late 2023.
