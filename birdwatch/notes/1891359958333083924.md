NNN - not granting privileged access to any reporter who wants to fly on the Presidential Aircraft is not equivalent imposing civil or criminal penalties and taking their property. The press is still free to say what they want.

NNN this is a swamp monster attempting peddle lies from politico as truth.

NNN.

Banning reporters from Air Force One does not violate free speech, this does not break the first amendment and thus your note is false.

Keep your opinion in the comments.

Stochastic terrorism is used to describe how inflammatory rhetoric can incite violence often through social media, to demonize a person or group. The instigator can use vague or coded language to create plausible deniability for any violence that occurs. Can be memes etc...

In the USA the government is punishing a news agency for exercising free speech.
