Genius Rainfall Cormorant, you do not understand how to use language if you believe one word of what you said is even adjacent to the neighborhood of truth. Stop posting notes.

NNN. Yes 'they' did. In the video at 1:15, 1:21, 1:23, 1:25, and 1:37 are explicit calls for the murder of all white people. This doesn't take into account what may be viewed as suggestive dog-whistles peppered throughout the rest of the video.
