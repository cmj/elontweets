This resembles genocide. https://t.co/mY8fow5JYp | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1898446725460660498

Background Blacks represent 79.8% of the population and whites 8.4%. 2017: white farmers thus hold 72% of the land. The claim that 60 white farmers are killed every day by black murderers is wrong. 49 murders took place on farms in 2023, 32 in 2024, black and white victims.
