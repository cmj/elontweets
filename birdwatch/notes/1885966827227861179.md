NNN. The post makes no claim as to why they only work 40 hours, just that they do. That is not incorrect.

Why does it seem like CN is trying so hard to troll everything that Elon posts about? Finding and eliminating government waste should be everyone's priority. We were heading to be a third world broke azz crap hole, be glad things are changing and stop believing the thieves.

These federal government employees are being responsible with tax dollars. They are forbidden from working more than 40 hours per week because they would have to be paid overtime and receive additional benefits in pension and other funds. https://federalworkerrights.com/fed-employee-pay-and-overtime/
