Elon Musk’s claim that DOGE and Obama’s 2011 EO are the same is false. Obama’s order cut internal costs (travel, printing) that didn’t need Congress. DOGE is closing agencies and cutting programs without approval, leading to legal challenges.

NNN: DOGE didn't and still doesn't have power to cut agencies. DOGE has been working with agencies to find waste/fraud/abuse and then report it to POTUS, agency heads, and Congress, who do have power to make these changes.
