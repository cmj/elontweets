[Mon Feb 10, 2025 17:40:34 UTC] @elonmusk (Harry B≈çlz)„Äêùóï„Äë: And it only gets better from here.  Tesla is still on track to launch autonomous ride hailing in Austin in June and roll out to many cities in America by the end of this year.  The threshold is achieving safety far in excess of the average human driver.  Ultimately, autonomous‚Ä¶ [@WholeMarsBlog] Tesla Full Self-Driving (Supervised) 13.2.7 took me from Oakland Airport to San Francisco, crossing the Bay Bridge, and I never touched the steering wheel or pedals once. https://t.co/nQNU0MipXv | ‚Ü≥ 4,959 ‚áÖ 6,881 ‚ô• 50,329 ü°ï 8,568,379 | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1889006561541882170

Post is an opinion and future speculation, nothing to do with anything from the past

Also, the note citing the articles about AV accidents are about Waymo and other AVs, not Teslas, and Waymo AVs are known for doing crazy things

As a known statistic, autonomous vehicles were involved in more crashes: 9.1 crashes per million miles traveled, compared to 4.1 for conventional cars. However, compared to injuries experienced in traditional vehicle collisions, the ones involving injury were minor.
