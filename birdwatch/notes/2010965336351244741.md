The LZ 129 Hindenburg airship (1930s) is the biggest flying object. (245m in length, 41.2m in diameter, and 200,000m³ in volume.)

The SpaceX Starship (full stack) is the biggest flying rocket, not object. (121m in height, 9m in diameter, and 7,500 m³ in approx. volume.)

NNN: The Hindenburg was a rigid airship, classified as an aerostat that uses static buoyancy from lighter-than-air gas for lift, rather than aerodynamic forces like airplanes. This technical distinction, per aviation terminology, makes it a floating craft, not a flying one. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship
