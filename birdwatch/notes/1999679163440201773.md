Ursula von der Leyen is elected by the MEPs. She campaigned in the same way campaigning is done in parliamentary democracies: to build political support and shaped parliamentary majorities. Here’s one example of her campaigning:

Voters in the US are aware of who their president is going to be. In the EU she was not mentioned anywhere during the campaigns for the EU elections.

Von der Leyen has been elected by the parliament. This is similar as election of Trump in US.
