There’s no evidence that the fires was caused by the left party. In past, there have been documented incidents of Tesla fires, some due to mechanical issues, particularly involving battery damage or thermal runaway

NNN: At this point, if you can't admit the current concerning anti Elon & Tesla movement is rapidly increasing hate and violence then you're having a very poor judgement. Please keep your biased opinion to replies.

As is a regular thing with Elon posts, it’s an opinion…if you don’t like it that’s what the replies are for

NNN: the pending note claims there is no evidence the cars were intentionally set on fire & it may have been simply a mechanical issue, then cited an article quoting police saying someone set the cars on fire, and the case is being investigated as arson.
