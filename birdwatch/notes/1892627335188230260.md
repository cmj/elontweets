Elon Musk is making unsubstantiated claims that the "missing money" appropriated by the US Congress to support Ukraine during the lastest Russian invasion ended up benefiting US politicians. Here see what Grok has to say:

US aid to Ukraine face regular audits by USAID & DoD Inspectors General. Claims of funds going to politicians are baseless. Zelenskyy has only received half the money, because only half has been disbursed ($96 billion remains of the $183 billion appropriated)
