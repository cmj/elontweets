NNN -- WTF are we doing in the CN? This is obviously a satire, there is literally no need for a community note.

This is obviously satire but the captions say "This is a real program" in different font which is not obvious, but IT IS FAKE!

I endorse the earlier community note.  Its not obviously satire.  Some of the stuff our government has been wasting money on is completely outrageous. https://www.whitehouse.gov/uncategorized/2025/02/at-usaid-waste-and-abuse-runs-deep/  Besides that the video claims the spending is real.

All these expenses originated in a comedy skit by TikTok creator Read Choi who pretended they were discovered by DOGE. The original video was labeled a skit, a meme and a sketch in the description and used the LOL hashtag.

I picked the ice cube uniformity at random and tried several combinations of search terms on Duck Duck Go and Google and only found references to this video. Is it real? How do we know? (I hope it is real personally)
