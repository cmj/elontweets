[Sat Feb 22, 2025 09:12:18 UTC] @elonmusk (Elon Musk)„Äêùóï„Äë: The executive branch must necessarily be subject to the will of the President, given that he is the elected representative of the people.  Otherwise, we do not live in a DEMOcracy, but rather a BUREAUcracy. [@shylockh] Every day for the past month, I've been reminded that for my entire life up to 2024, I was assured that it was impossible to fire civil servants in any meaningful quantity, that government departments couldn't ever be closed down. It was all lies. It just hadn't been tried. 1/ | Twitter for iPhone | birdwatch | https://x.com/_/status/1893227306199531761

Neighborly Marmalade Flowerpecker‚Äôs note ignores the fact that the Constitution already creates checks and balances. There is no power delegated to unelected executive branch employees to check the President. The note is entirely incorrect.

Independent, apolitical agencies are vital to maintaining democracy and preventing the weaponization of powerful parts of the executive. For instance, a politicized Federal Election Commission could be weaponized to tilt elections in favor of the incumbent party.
