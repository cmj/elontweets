This is X owner Elon Musk claiming noone will come to Americas aid.

When America was attacked in 9/11. The whole civilised world came to it's aid to destroy the terror network that led to the attack.

This is therefore a false statement.

The OP and Re-post are both opinions, and the given CN is based on an assumption of what is an unstated/potential event, making the note itself an opinion. As such, it belongs in the replies and not CNs.

NNN aside from it being an opinion the proposed note comparing middle east defence assistance with humanitarian aid within our borders misses the context of the opinion shown in the post.

CN note should be on the original post. 

Elon's single word post "Yes" is an indication of agreement with the post and an opinion.
