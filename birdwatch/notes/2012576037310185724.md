This’ a 2023 interview that Elon’s selectively posted, suggesting the BBC has fallen. The motive of the post remains disingenuous, claiming that it’s fallen so far from a selective interview where he deflected most of the questions asked. 

Here’s the interview & transcript.

If Mr Musk were not so full of shit, then he could easily address this issue properly, but he hides from it.
The ultimate arbiter of truth is proper scrutiny. It not difficult it just requires diligence and transparency, but that is the antithesis of what Musk represents.

This is a rehash of an interview done more than 2 years ago.   Musk was under constant media attack at this time. Maybe a time stamp would be helpful for those who missed the original broadcast.

NNN - Expressing one's opinion does not require a CN.  Frankly we have a bunch of ppl out here who don't like Elon who abuse CN.  Take it to the comments

With the transcript and Grok's analysis is possible to check if the BBC has 'fallen' and wich kind of personality was adopted by both Elon and the journalist
