This’ a 2023 interview that Elon’s selectively posted, suggesting the BBC has fallen. The motive of the post remains disingenuous, claiming that it’s fallen so far from a selective interview where he deflected most of the questions asked. 

Here’s the interview & transcript.

If Mr Musk were not so full of shit, then he could easily address this issue properly, but he hides from it.
The ultimate arbiter of truth is proper scrutiny. It not difficult it just requires diligence and transparency, but that is the antithesis of what Musk represents.
