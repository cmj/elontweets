NNN. Puede que Elon sea el director ejecutivo, pero no controla la información que se publica a través de su plataforma. Además, la existencia misma de notas comunitarias demuestra cómo la información no se compra ni se paga en X.

NNN - ALL proposed CN’s have the same message: i hate Elon and that’s why i’m quoting X’s competitor lies. 
-> If you like X’s competitors so much, why are you still here?

There is no need for context on personal opinion.

Besides the fact that X has an even distribution of opinions and thus is a great platform for free speech. 

Any rebuttal of personal opinions belongs on the comments section of the post.

This is an opinion. Stop abusing Community Notes and trying to put one on everything Elon Musk posts. Stick to the criteria.

NNN. Elon may be the CEO but he doesn't control what information is put out through his platform. Also, the very existence of community notes goes to show how information is not bought & paid for on X. Making a community note arguing or stating otherwise creates a paradox.

NNN - no note needed on personal opinions, that becomes abuse and personal vendettas. Best way to ruin a platform and user trust and support.

also if you're gonna use CNN and BBC as sources, you might as well use "Trust Me Bro"

Musk fa una constatazione totalmente personale ma non vi è certezza alcuna che corrisponda a verità, in effetti, nonostante Musk affermi il contrario molti account vengono ancora censurati e/o bloccati perennemente. https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2023/08/19/stop-al-blocco-degli-account-su-twitter-per-elon-musk-non-ha-senso-critiche-degli-utenti/7265457/

Others have pointed out that Musk is stating an opinion, and he is.

But this platform continues to restrict the reach of certain sites and accounts - a common complaint about the former ownership - and this undermines Musk's claim.

Post implies that there are no other platform that serves the internet with honest trustable information. 

Wikipedia is one counterfactual to that assertion.
