"Adversarial prompting" is tricking an LLM into bypassing design constraints, e.g. prompt injection or jailbreaks. The questions Grok answered were not "adversarial prompting." They were simple, straightforward questions that did not solicit pro-Elon responses.

Elon Musk is not actually mentally [slur], despite his claims.  

To be mentally [slur], you need an IQ of 85 or less.

Elon Musk has an estimated IQ of 124-130 based on his SAT scores.

This is a joke. It’s the same kind of way men insult for fun. have used forever. 

This style is funny, see: Norm Macdonald’s and a guest making a journal joke.

It's Word of the Year 2025 after winning last year as well.  It is only an insult if deserved and
