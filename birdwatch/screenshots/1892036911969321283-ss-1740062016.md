The astronauts were scheduled to return in Feb, but that has been delayed to late March due to testing of SpaceX Crew-10. The Crew-9 mission was reduced to 2 astronauts to leave room for Suni and Butch. That ship arrived in Aug and all astronauts have a return ship on the ISS.

Originally the astronauts were scheduled to return in June, 2024 not February, 2025.

Two astronauts aren't stuck because of political reasons, real reason is their Boeing spaceship had engine issues. 

Musk's Space X has themselves requested delay as they try to prepare their spaceship.

Important context: the astronauts themselves have long refuted the notion that they are "stuck"

“We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded”

Further, they cannot return until the Crew-9 team complete their mission and the Crew-10 mission arrives.
