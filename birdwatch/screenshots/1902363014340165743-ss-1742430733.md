The Senate does not impeach federal officials, The House of Representatives do. The Senate has the power to try all impeachment and it takes a 2/3 vote to remove any official—in other words—it would take 67 senators not 60.

The House of Representatives is responsible for impeachment. After the House impeaches, the Senate acts as the court, trying, the impeached official to either acquit or convict them. 

A 2/3 majority is needed for impeachment, in a full Senate that requires 67 votes, not 60.
