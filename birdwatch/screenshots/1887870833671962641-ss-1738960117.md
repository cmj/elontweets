Since buying X, Musk has improved its EBITDA margin from +13% to +46% despite revenue being halved. 

On approximately HALF the amount of revenues,  X is generating approximately TWO TIMES the amount of EBITDA.

Efficiency is an understatement.

NNN. Community Notes shouldn’t allow people who just want to express their opinions to judge posts. Take it to Comments, it doesn’t belong in CNs

CN writers that clearly abuse the purpose and intent of CN should be removed from access to contribute CNs.  Way too much of this type of abuse of the system.  Waste of time for people to have to counter / downvote obvious abuses.

NNN - this is a political cartoon expressing an opinion, and the attempt to community note it in the way the OP did is a clear-cut case of harassment / abuse of the community note system.

Ever since Twitter became X, its performance has declined significantly, becoming overrun with spam and bots far more than before. Depicting the app as a slim, healthy girl is not an accurate representation given the current situation

The slimmed down girl with the X shirt should be replaced by an ugly, smelly racist with a red MAGA hat, the text on the seated man's t-shirt should be democracy.
And Elon Musk is much more chunky.
