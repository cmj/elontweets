The CN appears to be addressing the quoted post, not the post it has been place on. It should be redirected to the quoted post. Additionally, it is incorrect, as the GDPNow analysis includes government spending.

Simon Kuznets warned against GDP being used in its simplest form for this very reason.  He said gov spending should not be included.  

OP statement is factual in that GDP can be manipulated by government actors.

However NNN because this is an opinion piece.

The United States already reports a measure of GDP excluding government spending, called "Value Added by Private Industries (VAPI)".  It currently accounts for 88.7% of US GDP and has steadily risen as a share of GDP since 2009, under both Obama and Biden as well as Trump:

The post explains how private sector GDP increases in nominal ($) terms. If there is no adjustment for inflation.

A more meaningful number is Private Sector GDP as a percentage of Total GDP.

It's my belief this is a measure much closer to what Elon is referring to

The US government's spending has a very small impact on GDP.

This tweet misleads about GDP. The Q1 GDPNow estimate projects declines in exports (-3.29%) and consumer spending (-1.0%), not government spending (-0.01%). This is a forecast, not confirmed data. Economists already analyze GDP components separately.
