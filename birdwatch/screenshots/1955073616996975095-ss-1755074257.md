Elon’s X manipulations (e.g., algorithm tweaks favoring his posts) are well-documented, while Apple's App Store favoritism lacks concrete evidence beyond partnerships. Hypocrisy undermines his antitrust claim.

NNN - "is behaving" refers to the current state of affairs. The fact that this wasn't true a month ago doesn't directly refute his claim that it is true now. In lieu of current evidence to the contrary, rebuttals should be left in the comments.

Sources that try to "prove" the OP is wrong, reference facts before the OpenAI - Apple deal on June 10. Elon suggests this is happening after that deal.
