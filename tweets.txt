[22/11/13 15:27:03] @elonmusk - @_hawko False. Twitter spends $13M/year on food service for SF HQ. Badge in records show peak occupancy was 25%, average occupancy below 10%.

[22/11/15 08:45:08] @elonmusk - @schrep Twitter is very slow in India, Indonesia & many other countries. This is fact, not “claim”. 10 to 15 secs to refresh homeline tweets is common.

[22/11/15 08:54:04] @elonmusk - @schrep There are ~1200 “microservices” server side, of which ~40 are critical to Twitter working at all, according to server control team.

Titter was trending to lose ~$3B/year (revenue drop of ~$1.5B + debt servicing of ~$1.5B) and had $1B in cash, so only 4 months of money. Extremely dire situation.

Positive news is nice to know, but negative news, for almost our entire evolutionary history, could mean death, so higher priority.

[23/08/22 12:50:04] @elonmusk - @jimkxa: Can you elaborate on how to achieve 1000x? At this point, we should just count the atoms, rather than say “2nm”.  Obviously, 2nm is just a marketing term, not the actual metal width, which is more like 20nm. But 1000x would still be smaller than the size of a carbon atom, if you use graphene, which is ~0.1nm.

[23/08/26 03:09:11] @elonmusk - @Scobleizer: An accurate assessment. What is also mindblowing is that the inference compute power needed for 8 cameras running at 36FPS is only about 100W on the Tesla-designed AI computer. This puny amount of power is enough to achieve superhuman driving! It makes a big difference that we run inference at int8, which is far more power-efficient than fp16. This requires us to do very difficult quantization-aware training at fp16 in or

To the best of my knowledge, Gates *still* has that massive bet against Tesla

In the long term, Neuralink hopes to play a role in AI risk civilizational risk reduction by improving human to AI (and human to human) bandwidth by several orders of magnitude.

[23/09/20 10:37:05] @elonmusk - Strange that there is almost no legacy media coverage of this. About 2 million people – from every country on Earth – are entering through the US southern border every year.

Their main purpose, and that of many other de facto defunct publications, is to manipulate public opinion by serving as a “mainstream media” source for Wikipedia, to provide probable cause for bogus government investigations and to cancel people who ignore the woke mind virus.
